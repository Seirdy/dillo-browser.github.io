The people over at www.ntk.net have written a little blurt about Dillo. Short
review from H4ck3r's perspective. It's notably how they had been the only ones
able to make a point of dillo's networking performance (not only rendering).
That's soothing to me, since I've worked very hard on it (two papers and
presentations at the SCCC 2000, that were not understood at all! :-)
