<h1>Personal info for Jorge Arellano Cid</h1>
<p> Name: Jorge A. Arellano Cid</p>
<p> <b>Notes:</b>

<p>  Here  I'll  write a bit about myself for those interested in
getting  a more informative picture of me. It's not a thing I'm
very fond of doing, as I much prefer people to judge me from what
I do.

<p>  I'll  start by mentioning  the  things  that are impossible to
guess, but if you're interested in the academic part here's my
<a href='resume1.html'>resume</a>.

<p>  I  like practicing sports and especially love to play tennis!
So  much that I managed to continue training and practicing while
studying at the University, up to reach the pro level! As you may
figure I had never much time to participate in the local tour but
when on vacation things changed.

<p>  It  is  interesting to remark that it was an extraordinarily
well  suited  complementary  activity  for  my studies. Sometimes
after  those brain-stressing study-devoted periods my brains were
so  tired  that  nothing  else could be done but rest. Instead of
that  I  picked  up my racquets and went on playing hard. After a
couple  of  hours  I was ready to start again, and with a renewed
mental clarity and forces.

<p>  I'm  also interested in metaphysics and psychology, and so I
have  dedicated a lot of time to studying them both. I've 
definitively dedicated more time to metaphysics but I don't want to
write about it here (please excuse me). Concerning psychology, I'm
much  more  fond  of  cognitive  psychology  than of the clinical
branch.  I  started  reading  and  learning  about  it when I was
fourteen  or  so.  At  the  time,  my  mother  taught  cognitive
psychology  at  the  University (PUC) so go figure, I had all the
books and a private teacher at home!

<p> I specially like the work of J. Piaget, S. Freud and F. Perls.
Along  the  years,  picking  a bit of every one of them, plus some
doses  of "Infusing thinking" I started to coordinate a tentative
theory   about  (in  lack  of  a  better  expression):  "suitable
cognitive sets".

<p>

<p>  I  developed  an educational computer game, in the form of a
text  adventure  (plus  some  written  material), to teach how to
interact with and  use  computers,  and  tested  some of the concepts
there. The results were amazing!

<p>  People learned at their pace, with unexpected enthusiasm and
dedication.  The  concepts  were  quickly  or  slowly assimilated
depending on the player's interest and abilities.

<p> Everything went right until the player realized that the game
resembled their life (and they behaved as in the
"real  world"  in  a  similar  way  that the personality projects
itself over a chess board).

<p>  In  brief,  those  that  had  no troubles with their present
existence   continued,   solving  the  problems,  practicing  and
learning!  Quite  a  success,  but those that were feeling uneasy
with their life started to disengage from the game.

<p>  I  learned  a lot of things from the experience, and applied
some  of  the  concepts  to  Dillo's user interface. That's why I
rejoice when people state in their recognition emails that one of
the  things they like most is the uncluttered or easy-to-use user
interface.  And  it  can  be  much  better because it's still not
finished nor polished!

<hr>
<p>
  Oh, I've said a lot! Let's finish with the studies part...
<hr>

<p> 
I  graduated  as  an Informatics Civil Engineer, in Chile, at the
UTFSM  (6  years  study plan + thesis + practices). At that time,
late  1999, everybody expected me to continue with the PhD, and I
was  offered some choices. At the same time I was considering the
idea  of starting the Dillo project, and I knew it was impossible
to  undertake  both  endeavours  at  the  same time, so I faced a
decision.

<p> I considered that if I went for the academic degree, in a few
years  I  could  have it done, and certainly benefit from it, but
that would also mean that the world would have never seen Dillo.

<p>  I  pondered  both options and decided that the Dillo project
and its
<a href='../funding/objectives.html'>objectives</a>
were  much  more  important,  and so I started it (and that's why
you're here!).

<p>
The  hardest  part  of being dedicated full time to the Dillo project
has  been to find a way to pay for my material existence. This is too
complex  a project to undertake on a spare-time basis, so there's
no  choice,  it  needs  full-time dedication. Having made it this
far,  almost  four  years,  living out of some ocassional income,
restraining  expenses  to  a minimum, has been an incredibly hard
path.

<p>  The  intangible  rewards,  though, largely exceed those of a
lifetime.
