  <h1> Achieved Goals</h1>

    <h2> (Chronological order)</h2>
    <hr>

    <ul>
    <li> Introduced a new Domain Name Resolver engine. It's a 98%-new
         thread-based (pthreads), non-blocking stable design. The good news is
         that it allows gdb debugging and compatibility with libc5 systems; two
         major features that were missing with the former scheme. </li>

     <li> Designed a <A href="NC_design.html">Naming&amp;Coding standard</A> 
          for the project. </li>
  
     <li> Introduced an interactive bug-track engine at the Web site. It allows
          developers and testers to coordinate their efforts, and also serves as
          an information center on project status. </li>

     <li> Introduced other interactive pages that helped to coordinate particular
          tasks (as stage 1 of the Naming&amp;Coding effort).</li>

     <li> Introduced the layered Naming&amp;Coding design into the the source
          tree (up to stage 1).<br> It helps developers to easily understand
          Dillo's internal function calls, and to figure it out quickly where
          they came from. It also provides a two layer ADT (Abstract Data Type)
          that serves as an all around lib (when prefixed 'a_') and as a module
          lib (when prefixed with the module name).<br> It also provides a
          framework that supports concurrent developing.
          <!-- <br> You can check stage 1 log <a href="Dname.html">here</a>. --> </li>

     <li> Completed stage 2 of the Naming&amp;Coding effort. It was a 1.2 Mb
          source!<br> (Stage 2 was the last stage) </li>

     <li> Removed all compile time warnings from the source</li>

     <li> Added PNG image support </li>

     <li> Added POST method support </li>

     <li> Standarized all the memory management to glib functions </li>

     <li> Fixed the image rendering bugs that were affecting GIFs and JPGs </li>

     <li> Improved rendering with support for image resizing (images without
          size tags) </li>

     <li> Fixed the plugin handler (FTP works again) </li>

     <li> Fixed bugs that affected image URLs (segfaults) </li>

     <li> Documented internal work of the browser (to be extended) </li>

     <li> Eliminated several memory leaks </li>

     <li> Introduced a readable config file for preferences </li>

     <li> Made a public developer's release; a major milestone in our project,
          cause we had a lot of work to make it possible.<br> </li>

     <li> Reimplemented the whole networking process (One half of the browser is
          completely NEW) </li>

     <li> Stabilized dillo to a better degree than gzilla-0.2.2 (another milestone!) </li>

     <li> Made a public announcement in freshmeat and in
          comp.os.linux.announce.<br> Finally the house-cleanning has finished
          and we have a stable, consistent, commented, documented and extensible
          code base to work on. <br> (Thanks to everyone that contributed to
          make it possible.)</li>

     <li> Fixed the blank rendering bug </li>

     <li> Documented dillo widget! </li>

     <li> Designed and implemented a new data-transfer mechanism for internal
          layers </li>

     <li> Redesigned the cache to hold both images and pages, and to handle its
          clients with a primary key </li>

     <li> Added ISINDEX support </li>

     <li> Made several fixes, improvements and extensions </li>

     <li> Rewrote most of the Dw module from scratch! </li>

     <li> Reimplemented image rendering with GdkRGB and the new DwImage </li>

     <li> Enabled dillo to work with low screen depths </li>

     <li> Fixed lots of memory leaks </li>

     <li> Improved error-handling in the IO engine. </li>

     <li>Rewrote the HTML tag parsing functions in a standards compliant 
     way.</li>
                                                                               
     <li>Introduced an optimized URL resolving module (96% RFC2396
     compliant). </li>
     
     <li>Reduced dicache's memory usage. </li> 
     
     <li>Added cookies support! (RFC-2965 compliant).</li>
     
     <li>Restarted working on simple plugins design (dpi1)</li>

     <li>Added IPv6 support!
     <li>Implemented alignments inside tables
     <li>Added iterators (the basis for find text and future copy&amp;paste
     <li>Added a simple command line interface
     <li>Made Dillo embeddable into other GTK+ applications!
     <li>Extended the Concomitant Control Chain (CCC) theory to 
         allow bidirectional message passing.
     <li>Extended IO's functionallity with a threaded operation that
       allows buffered writes of small chunks on the same FD.
     <li>Used the new CCC and IO to implement dillo plugins! (dpi).
     <li>Wrote a dpi-program for bookmarks.
     <li>Implemented Copy&amp;Paste! (aka. Text selection)

     <li>Introduced a new way of handling dillo plugins! Now the
         communications and managing is done by a daemon: dpid.
         This comes with a lot of advantages described in Dpid.txt.
     <li>Developed a plugin for downloads. It uses wget and can handle
         several connections at the same time.
     <li>Developed a plugin for FTP.
     <li>Made an example plugin (hello), and 
         started developing the https plugin.
     <li>Adapted the generic parser to make HTML error detection, providing
         the line number and a hint (expected tag) in the error message!
         -- this feature is also known as the <em>bug meter</em>.
     <li>Added a context sensitive popup menu for images.
     <li>Made even more portability enhancements.
     <li>Made significant improvements to the HTML parser. This brings
         better HTML rendering, and better bug detection (hints).
     <li>Tested dillo extensively on several platforms reaching the
         very stable beta SW status.
     <li>Finished the feasibility analysis for an FLTK port.
     <li>Orthogonalized the generic parser:
      <ul>
       <li> Fixes memory leaks and widget state when recovering from bad
            HTML.
       <li> Improves error detection and validation (needed by XHTML).
       <li> Makes DOC tree generation possible (needed by CSS).
       <li> Cleaner design of handling routines for bad HTML.
       <li> Orthodox treatment of double optional elements (HTML, HEAD,
            BODY).
       <li> Lots of minor code cleanups.
      </ul>
     <li>Cookies became a plugin to allow sharing between multiple copies
         of dillo.
     <li>New Abstraction Layer.
     <li>New image handling code.
     <li>Parsing of empty XML tags (e.g &lt;script/&gt; as
         &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;).
     <li>Port to FLTK2.
     <li>Universal CCC (Concomitant Control Chain) idea.
     <li>Implement tabs in the user interface.
     <li>Rewrite of tables code.
     <li>accept multiple character sets (in both HTTP and META).
     <li>optional image loading.
     <li>gzip decoder.
     <li>64-bit ready out of the box.
     <li>Implement the "file input" control for forms.
     <li>Optimized scrolling.
     <li>HTTP-1.1's chunked transfer support.
     <li>GUI dpi for downloads.
     <li> Basic authentication.                                                
     <li> Configurable keybindings.
     <li> Empty cache-entries removal.
     <li> DPI cleanup.                                                         
     <li> Cookies cleanup.
     <li> Limit concurrent connections to a host.                              
     </ul>
