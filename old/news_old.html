  <p>
   <b>Dillo-3.0.1</b> has been released!
   <p>
    Dillo-3.0.1 brings improved privacy, never sending or accepting
    third-party cookies. Also, the <a href="screenshots/index.html">UI theme</a> can
    be changed, keys can be set for paging left/right, and you can disable the
    dialog that pops up when quitting with multiple tabs/windows open.
   <p>
  <b>[08-Sep-2011]</b>
  <p>
   <b>Dillo-3.0</b> has been released!
   <p>
   In Dillo3, we have shifted from fltk2 to the fltk-1.3 series. The
   experimental status of fltk2 had kept Dillo2 out of a number of
   distributions, but fltk-1.3 has already seen
   <a href="http://fltk.org/articles.php?L1086">an official release</a>,
   clearing the way for dillo to return to all of these distributions
   and bring safe lightweight graphical browsing to those users.
   <p>
   Using fltk-1.3 also means that OSX users can run dillo3 on Cocoa.
   <p>
   Some other interesting changes:
   <ul>
   <li>Default binding for close-all changed from Alt-q to Ctrl-q.
   <li>Default binding for close-tab changed from Ctrl-q to Ctrl-w.
   <li>Default binding for left-tab changed to Shift-Ctrl-Tab.
   <li>Rewrote the User Interface: much simpler design and event handling.
   <li>Added on-the-fly panel resize (tiny/small/medium and normal/small icons).
   <li>'hide-panels' key action now hides the findbar if present,
        and toggles display of the control panels otherwise.
   <li>Allow multiple search engines to be set in dillorc, with a menu
       in the web search dialog to select between them.
   <li>Added an optional label to dillorc's search_url.<br>
       Format: "[&lt;label&gt; ]&lt;url&gt;"
   <li>Add right_click_closes_tab preference (default is middle click).
   <li>Allow binding to non-ASCII keys and multimedia keys.
   <li>Avoid a certificate dialog storm on some HTTPS sites (BUG#868).
   <li>Enable line wrapping for &lt;textarea&gt;. (BUG#903)
   <li>Avoid double render after going Back or Forward
       (it takes half the time now!)
   <li>Implemented a custom tabs handler (to allow fine control of it).
   <li>Rewrote dw's crossing-events dispatcher (avoids redundant events).
   <li>Fixed a years old bug: stamped tooltips when scrolling with keyboard.
   <li>Fixed a border case in URL resolver: empty path + {query|fragment}
        (BUG#948)
   <li>Cancel the expected URL after offering a download (BUG#982)
   <li>Eliminated a pack of 22 compiler warnings (gcc-4.6.1 amd64)
   <li>Removed 'large' option of panel_size preference.
   <li>Removed --enable-ansi configure option.
   <li>Limit saved cookie size.
   <li>Wrap image alt text.
   <li>Added support for CSS adjacent sibling selectors.
   <li>Fix redraw loops and reenabled limit_text_width dillorc option.
   <li>Collapse parent's and first child's top margin.
   </ul>
  <p>
  <b>[26-Jul-2011]</b>
  <p>
   <b>Dillo-2.2.1</b> has been released!
   <p>
   This is the final release of Dillo2, which depends on the
   <a href="http://fltk.org/articles.php?L825">moribund</a> FLTK2,
   and the big news is that Dillo3, a port to FLTK-1.3, is expected to be
   available in a matter of weeks! FLTK-1.3 is actively developed, and 1.3.0
   was <a href="http://fltk.org/articles.php?L1086">released</a> last
   month.
   <p>
   As for
   <a href="dillo-2.x/ChangeLog.html">new features</a>,
   some highlights are: more CSS properties, cookies changes, and handling
   of page source now uses a DPI (plugin).
  <p>
  <b>[11-Feb-2010]</b>
  <p>
   <b>Dillo-2.2</b> has been released!
   <p>
   In this release, you will find: a major overhaul of the cookies subsystem
   including important security fixes, a reimplementation of the Dillo Plugin
   (DPI) API, a configurable HTTP connection limit, improved CSS, and
   <a href="http://hg.dillo.org/dillo/file/tip/ChangeLog">plenty more</a>.
  <p>
  <b>[03-Jul-2009]</b>
  <p>
   <b>Dillo-2.1.1</b> has been released to provide a security fix for
   malicious images. A few small
   <a href="http://hg.dillo.org/dillo/file/tip/ChangeLog">improvements</a>
   in CSS, key bindings, etc., found their way in as well.
   <p>
   Thanks go to oCERT for bringing the matter to our attention.
  <p>
  <b>[20-Jun-2009]</b>
  <p>
   <b>Dillo-2.1</b> has been released!
   <p>
   This release comes with a major improvement: <b>basic CSS!</b>
   <p>
   The assorted goodies (e.g. configurable keybindings)
   are summarized in the splash page (about:splash),
   and extensively detailed in the
   <a href="http://hg.dillo.org/dillo/file/tip/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>.
   <p>
   If  you  like what you see in this release, and want to see the
   Dillo project thrive, please help us. <b>We need developers</b>.

   Thanks to the people who appreciate Dillo and help us to move it forward.
  <p>
  <b>[14-Oct-2008]</b>
  <p>
   Dillo-2.0 has been released!
   Today, after a long period of inactivity, a new release was made.
   It's been a <a href="https://www.dillo.org/8years.html">long way</a> and this
   <b>dillo-2.0</b> release comes with a
   boatload of <a href="http://hg.dillo.org/dillo/file/tip/ChangeLog">
   improvements</a>.
   <p>
   In dillo2, you will find: tabbed browsing, antialiasing, different
   character  sets,  accepting  compressed pages, control over image
   loading,  smaller footprint, near 50% smaller memory usage, fewer
   dependencies,  better  table  rendering,  bugfixes, improved GUI,
   among others!
  <p>
  <b>[25-Feb-2007]</b>
  <p>
   The Dillo project is frozen:
   <ul>
    <li>Frozen, waiting for funds or sponsorship.
    <li>Looking for interested developers that want to work steadily on it.
    <li>Both core developers have regular jobs and have almost no spare time.
    <li>We have a
        <a href='Plans.html'>very advanced</a>
        port of Dillo to
        <a href='http://www.fltk.org'>FLTK2</a>.
   </ul>
   <p>
   A web browser is too complex a task to develop on a part time basis, and it
   also is a fast-moving target.
   I dedicated seven years full-time
   to it, and I'm willing to dedicate more. This doesn't depend on me anymore
   as I had to take a job to pay the bills. We made great achievments with Dillo
   and it would be easy to quickly push FLTK2-Dillo if we could have both core
   developers working full time on it. This is a tiny deal for some sponsors (e.
   Cell phone maker), and we wish it could happen soon. Through this time we've
   been supported by individual's donations, and we thank them indeed for
   believing in our project and to help make it grow to what it is.
   <p>
   If you as a reader, or user, or interested party have a good idea, sponsorship
   or development time to devote, please don't hesitate to contact
   <a href="authors/jcid-email.html">me</a> to
   try to arrange for the future of Dillo.

  <p> <b>[02-May-2006]</b>
<p>
 Dillo-0.8.6 was released. This is hopefully the last GTK1-based Dillo.
  <p>
 You'll find plenty of fixes and improvements in this tarball. Most
 notably on downloads. Just check the Changelog.
  <p>
 OTOH, our FLTK2-based branch is advanced enough to aim on making our next
 release with it.
  <p>
  When? This depends on funding.

  <p> <b>[15-Jun-2005]</b>
<p>
 0.8.5 was released with some minor fixes, most notably a couple of security 
 fixes.  Upgrade if you haven't already! <br>
 This release is one of the last on the GTK1-based Dillo series.
 Currently the main development is focused on a FLTK2-based dillo prototype.
 If everything goes as planned, and no critical bugs are found, this new branch
 will become our next release! (stay tuned).

  <p> <b>[11-Jan-2005]</b>
<p>
Today, two and a half months after the former release, the new
<b><font color='purple'>dillo-0.8.4</font></b> was released!
<p>
It comes with several goodies. The most remarkable is the fix of
a memory leak bug that can lead to reduced virtual size memory usage by
a factor of 2 to 20 on average! (this depends on usage, pthreads
library and OS).
<p>
The other big improvement is the ortogonalization of the parser. This
brings several benefits detailed in the Changelog.
<p>
Finally, among the usual enhancements and improvements,
a security bug was also fixed.
<p>
Our advice is to <b><font color='purple'>upgrade ASAP</font></b>.

  <p> <b>[27-Oct-2004]</b>
<p>
After a long period of work, the new 
<b><font color='purple'>dillo-0.8.3</font></b> was released today.
<p>    
It  comes  with  a parser that's able to use W3C's semantics plus
some  heuristics.  This  improves  the  rendering  of  sites that
deliver  non-valid  HTML.  It  is  expected to provide for better
results  than the venerable dillo-0.7.3, while keeping the useful
diagnostic messages of the
<a href='help/bug_meter.html'>bug meter</a>.

  <p> <b>[09-Jul-2004]</b>
<p>
Just out of popular demand, a
<a href='donations.html'>donations</a> link
was added. This may give us the opportunity to work full time on Dillo, and
thus keep improving it at a much faster pace.
<p>
All the plans, required knowledge and will is there (i18n, antialiasing, better rendering,
frames, https, FLTK, more plugins, ...), but we _need_ to be working on it
full-time, to keep with the pace of the evolving technologies.

  <p> <b>[06-Jul-2004]</b>
  <p>
The new <b><font color='purple'>dillo-0.8.2</font></b>
was released today. C'mon, go get it!<br>
Except from the usual bug-fixes and improvements, some new features snuck in.
One nifty feature is the save and open file dialogs remembering the last directory opened. Also, a "start_page" option in the preferences so that you may override the splash screen. <br>

<p> <b>[14-May-2004]</b>
<p>    
0.8.1 is finally here. After extensive testing on several platforms
(see <a href='Compatibility.html'>compatibility</a>),
it is no longer alpha SW but very
<b><font color='purple'>stable beta!</font></b>.
<p>    
This release comes with better HTML rendering, mainly due
to the improved html-parser.
<p>
The <a href='help/bug_meter.html'>bug meter</a> was
also enhanced as a direct result from the improved parser.   
We hope it will serve even better the already satisfied web
authors that use it to check and correct the HTML in their
sites. --Thanks for the feedback and for adhering the
<a href='help/bug_meter.html#standards'>standards</a>.

  <p> <b>[08-Feb-2004]</b>
    <p>
    0.8.0 has been released! A major milestone that comes with the largest
    Changelog ever! It has lots of improvements and advances, and also
    features the new <a href='help/bug_meter.html'>bug meter</a>.
    <p>
Did you know that the Yopy 3700 ships with dillo inside?

  <p> <b>[07-Aug-2003]</b>
    <p>
    0.7.3 has been released! It comes with improved performance,
    important bugfixes and a new set of toolbar Icons!
  <p> <b>[25-Jun-2003]</b>
    <p>
    <a href='http://www.gnutec.com/~amonk/'>Kyle</a> gently prepared
    a <a href='http://www.gnutec.com/~amonk/software/moz2dil.pl'>script</a>
    to translate your mozilla bookmarks to dillo.
  <p> <b>[29-Apr-2003]</b>    
    <p>
    The long awaited 0.7.2 release was made. It comes with 
    Copy&amp;Paste!
    <p>
    Dillo is getting into a second stage in its development life.
    We're very close to doing: HTTPS, FTP, downloads and more!
    <p>
    We only need to get some funds, settle the core working group,
    organize the job, and quick results will feed the line!


  <p> <b>[10-Mar-2003]</b>
    <p>
    A BugFix release was made (0.7.1.2). It solves the problem of
dissapearing bookmarks among other things. Please upgrade ASAP.
  <p> <b>[17-Feb-2003]</b>
    <p>
    Dillo 0.7.0 is finally out! Get it while it's hot!
    <br>
    This  release  is a major milestone. It features the new plugin
    framework:  a gateway to extend dillo and to interface with external
    programs. (It is not compatible with other browsers' plugins.)
    <P>
    Dillo plugins
    (<a href='dpi1.html'>dpi</a>)
    allow extending  the  browser without increasing its core size. It even
    allows using dillo as a GUI!
    <P>
    We  also  made  this  dillo  embeddable!  All the rendering and
    surfing  capabilities  can be used from another GTK+ application.
    For instance, check this
    <a href='http://melvin.hadasht.free.fr/dillo/sylpheed/spamsafe-0.7.0.png'>screenshot</a> from the
    <a href='http://melvin.hadasht.free.fr/dillo/sylpheed/'>
    sylpheed-claws</a> email client.
    <P>
    Now  dillo  does  IPv6, highlights found text and uses a plugin
    program to manage its bookmarks.
    <P>
    Some other very nice features and improvements include:
    <ul>
       <li> Added a simple command line interface, and enabled some options.
       <li> Improved alignment inside tables:
       <ul>
         <li> LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER, JUSTIFY, CHAR,
         <li> TOP, BOTTOM, MIDDLE, BASELINE. </ul>
       <li> Made dillo embeddable into other GTK+ applications.
       <li> Concomitant Control Chain (CCC):
       <ul>
         <li> Extended the theory to allow bidirectional message passing.
         <li> Reimplemented dillo's core with the new chains. </ul>
       <li> Input/Output engine (IO):
       <ul>
         <li> Extended the functionallity with a threaded operation that
              allows buffered writes of small chunks on the same FD.
         <li> Created a new IO API, and adapted dillo to it. </ul>
     <li> Used the new CCC and IO to implement dillo plugins! (dpi).
     <li> Wrote a dpi-program for bookmarks.
     <li> Added IPv6 support! [./configure --enable-ipv6]
     <li> Rewrote findtext with highlighting and a case-sensitive option.
     <li> Added a tiny warning/handler for meta refresh.
     <li> <b>Lots</b> of other enhancement and fixes. Check out the Changelog!
  </ul>

  <p> <b>[19-Dec-2002]</b>
  <p>

          <li> Added support for rendering adjacent &lt;BR&gt;, Tabs in &lt;PRE&gt;,

          <li> Bound the space key to PgDn, and 'b' | 'B' to PgUp.
