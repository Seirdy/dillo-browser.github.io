<h2>What is "Good UI"?</h2>

<p>As far as I can tell from user posts on mailing lists and
magazine/webzine reviews, to your average technically-inclined
Internet resident a good UI means you have a lot of features, or
alternatively that you have a lot of snazzy graphics, or alternatively
that your UI is just like one that the commentator has used in the
past.

<p>I don't have any genius definition of "good UI"; I'm not a UI
expert. But it clearly doesn't mean snazzy graphics or featuritis.  In
the end when I think good UI I think of MacOS classic: clean, simple,
consistent, productive. You focus on your work or play and the GUI
isn't in the way. OS X adds the cool graphics too, but those aren't
the part that makes it a good UI, just the part that makes it fun.

<p>Another element of good UI is attention to all the little details:
good error dialogs, setting up keyboard navigation, dealing with
relayout when a window gets resized, accessibility,
internationalization. People don't usually know how to evaluate these
aspects of a UI, unless they're experienced UI designers or GUI
programmers.

<p>I suppose I have a <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000057.html">Cliff's
notes</a> approach to good UI and the real UI designers will laugh,
but ah well. It's a decent heuristic. ;-)

<p>So anyhow, when I talk about a good UI that's a vague definition of
what I mean.

<br><br>
<h2>The Question of Preferences</h2>

<p>The most-often-mentioned example of bad free software UI is "too
many preferences." This is pretty much my pet peeve; I was inspired to
write a whole window manager on the premise that current window
managers suffer from preferences overload.

<p>A traditional free software application is configurable so that it
has the union of all features anyone's ever seen in any equivalent
application on any other historical platform. Or even configurable to
be the union of all <i>applications</i> that anyone's ever seen on any
historical platform (Emacs *cough*).

<p>Does this hurt anything? Yes it does. It turns out that preferences
have a cost. Of course, <i>some</i> preferences also have important
benefits - and can be crucial interface features. But each one has a
price, and you have to carefully consider its value. Many users and
developers don't understand this, and end up with a lot of cost and
little value for their preferences dollar.

<p> [...]


<br><br>
<h2>So how do you decide which preferences to have?</h2>

<p>On hearing that preferences have a cost, some people get upset that
we're going to remove every preference, or that their favorite one is
gone, or whatever.

<p>Step back for a minute and think about the preferences problem.

<p>For any program, there are literally an infinite number of possible
preferences. Each one has a cost. A program with infinite preferences
is therefore infinitely bad. But clearly some preferences are
genuinely useful and important. So the UI developer's job is to choose
the useful subset of possible preferences.

<p>An argument that "preferences are good" or "preferences are bad" is
clearly unproductive. Only an argument that draws a line between when
a preference should exist, and when it should not, is a meaningful
argument that impacts real-world developer decisions.

<p>The traditional, de facto free software line between when a
preference should exist and when it shouldn't is "a preference should
exist if someone implements it or asks for it." No one is going to
seriously defend this one though. At least, no one who's maintained an
application and seen the sheer number of non-overlapping
feature/preference requests you typically receive can take this one
seriously.

<p>Just as Linus rejects most kernel patches these days - but probably
took more of them back in the Linux 0.1 era - as free software
matures, more preferences will be rejected.

<p>So how is the decision made? It's a judgment call. I try to go
through some questions like these:

<ul> 

<li>Ask questions to find out what's really bugging someone who
requests a preference.  What is the annoyance or inefficiency that
prompted them to ask?

<li>Can said annoyance be made to go away for all users without
requiring a preference?  If so, just do that. You may have to think
about the big picture of the UI to figure out how to make it Just
Work.

<li>Is the annoyance or inefficiency really significant, or did it
cost them 1 second doing something that users do once per week on
average? If it's just some trivial thing, then the extra feature or
preference probably costs more than it's worth, even if you can't 
make things Just Work.

<li>Does any other OS have this feature or preference? I'm all for
innovation, but if no one else is doing something, you should think it
through twice to be sure there isn't a <i>reason</i> they aren't doing
it. If you're appropriately humble you'll probably find that a lot of
thought and user testing has gone into the currently popular
platforms.

</ul>

<p>The main point is to set limits. Figure you have some fixed number
of slots for preferences; is the preference in question worth
"spending" one of those slots? Once spent it's hard to free a slot up
again. Keep in mind that preferences have a cost, and demand that each
preference have some real value.


<br><br>
<h2>Why all this obsession with preferences anyway?</h2>

<p>I find that if you're hard-core disciplined about having good
defaults that Just Work instead of lazily adding preferences, that
naturally leads the overall UI in the right direction. Issues come up
via bugzilla or mailing lists or user testing, and you fix them in
some way other than adding a preference, and this means you have to
think about the right UI and the right way to fix problems.
