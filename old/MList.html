<h3>Please read carefully before posting:</h3>
      <P>
      This mailing list has a long tradition of polite, respectful,
      technically skilled and cooperative email interchange, and,
      <em>we love it that way!</em>
      <P>
      Back in the old days when I was at the university, a memorable
      teacher told us that the toughest problem of gathering a working
      team of highly skilled to brilliant-considered individuals was
      that those guy's egos were bigger than a whole cathedral, and
      that they would avoid cooperating with each other in the pursuit
      of demonstrating that they were the best overall, and that they
      could undertake the whole task without the aid of anyone!
      <P>
      He was right...
      <P>
      I had come to observe that really brilliant or knowledgeable
      people (up to geniuses), don't behave that way. They know what
      they're worth, and thus doesn't have to demonstrate anything.
      <P>
      Even more, the latter ones are the most cooperative,
      encouraging and open to share their valuable knowledge, when it
      comes to help their colleagues to improve their skills.
      <P>
      The excellent news is that being a genius is not a requirement
      for adopting that working spirit; <em>and so we did!</em>

          <b>Not available at present.</b>
          <p>
          <s>If you just want notification of releases, go to freecode's

          page and click the "follow" button. This will require a freecode

        <dt>
	  <strong>Low traffic</strong>
        <dd>
          We have a lot of subscribers, but the traffic is low. I
          believe that's one of the main reasons for that! The other one is
          that having to be concise, tends to improve the quality of the
          post.
        <dt>
	  <strong>Being concise</strong>
        <dd>
          Please don't brainstorm to the list. Document yourself and
          try to sort your mind before you let others know what you think.
        <dt>
	  <strong>Positive feedback</strong>
        <dd>
          Thanks-for posts are very welcomed. I receive a lot of them,
          and sometimes I wish they'd be sent directly to the mailing list
          with a view to let every developer enjoy his share.
        <dt>
	  <strong>Where to send patches</strong>
        <dd>
          You can send them to
          <a href="authors/jcid-email.html">me</a>.
          If your patch is small and you need to share it for advice, send
          it to the mailing list. If it's <em>big</em>, let the mailing list
	  know and either set an URL with it, or email directly to interested
	  people.
        <dt>
	  <strong>Offensive posts</strong>
        <dd>
          You're strongly encouraged NOT to answer any unpolite or
          unrespectful post. This silent exclusion will gently invite the
          poster to reconsider his writings or leave the list.
