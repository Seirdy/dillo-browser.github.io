Problems:
1: overwrites text with images.
2: crops images (aspect ratio).
3: different layout.
4: overwrites text with float.
5: overwrites text with text.
6: CPU HOG with: t2.n, t2.n.sm
7: Missing page sections (sometimes works for the same page).
8: Small images cut in two sometimes ("ESP", "CRO", ...)
9: Wrong aspect ratio for images (text line height)
10: Page drawn with offset (but browser thinks other section is on screen).
11: CPU HOG.
12: CPU HOG with: t1, t1n, t2.n, t2.n.sm, t3.
13: overwrites text and images with text and images.

Goods:
*: works for the whole t.* suite.

Testing (all with background images disabled):

BTG:
 1.- Bck/Fwd several times (first at normal then maximized).
 2.- resize from max to normal several times.

pravda #1:
 1. Load [1] at normal size, wait most images to load, check images and check
    them not to overlap text, go Bck/Fwd, check again.
 2. Maximize window, check images don't overlap text, check the page layout
    to have three main columns (the upper part). Go Bck/Fwd, check again.

pravda #2:
 1. Load [1] at normal size, wait most images to load, then load [2],
    press page down, check the "print version" float doesn't overlap text,
    or images (they may stack), check the two images inside it have the
    same size and ratio, maximize, return to normal, check the float again.

4ta:
1. Run dillo, disable images, load 4ta.html, click Girl img, go Bck/Fwd,
   check img, exit dillo.
2. Run dillo, disable images, load 4ta.html, click football img, go Bck/Fwd,
   check img, click dep.png img, check images, go Bck/Fwd, check images.
3. Run dillo, disable images, load 4ta.html, click tauro img, check horoscope
   text, go Bck/Fwd, check h. text, click aries img, check h. text, go Bck/Fwd,
   check h. text, exit dillo.

VT:
 1. Load [3] at normal size, wait for most images to load, go Bck/Fwd, check
   images and text not to override each other.

PV:
 1. Load [5] at normal size, wait for most images to load, search for "re-re"
    with Find Text, press page down (you'll see an image), go Bck/Fwd, check
    the image is there. If not, you can place the cursor where the image was,
    if you get a hand cursor, Dillo thinks it is there. Wait for the tooltip
    and drag it a bit downwards to the right, Dillo will repaint from the image
    data.
