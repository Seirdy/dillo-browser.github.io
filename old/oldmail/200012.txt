[Dillo-dev]ALT attribute in `img' tag

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2000-12-27 20:17

Hi all!

Recently I've inserted bug #116, to support ALT attributes in `img'
tags. Starting out the code, I realized that some of the needed
changes would go in dw_page.c and possibly html.c. Well I just read in
Allan's News, that Sebastian is planning to release his new Dw...

Sebastian, have you done anything about the ALT attribute? And if
not should I wait a while for you to release what your doing before
trying to support ALT?

best regards,

[Dillo-dev]Window geometry (get_size fix and new dillorc option)

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2000-12-26 06:04

Hi guys,

I've recently joined gtk list at gtk-list@gn..., and learned the
proper way of finding out a window's dimension. I was getting:
window->allocation.width
window->alloction.height

in the patch I sent to make a new windows the same as parent
one. Seems that the "right" way to do it is calling
`gdk_window_get_size()`. I've already sent a patch to Jorge fixing
this up.. sorry guys.

While I was on that "theme", I started to think about making an
option in dillorc for initial geometry size, because the first thing I
do when I open Dillo, is resize it...

So that's what I've done. But I'm not sure the patch is good,
specially the string manipulations I've done to extract width and
height. The patch is at (I'm not sending it attached since it's 
5k == 130 lines long):
http://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/geometry_pref.diff

The sintax in your dillorc, should be something like:

> geometry="800x600"

The patch changes the following files:

dillorc: added comments and the above example
commands.c: changes the window size method to `gdk_window_get_size()',
like described abouve.
dillo.c: changed window initialization to get the preference size.
prefs.c: humm... did it! Look at my string stuff to see if I'm doing
it right
prefs.h: added
> #define DW_GEOMETRY_DEFAULT_WIDTH 640
> #define DW_GEOMETRY_DEFAULT_HEIGHT 550

and `width' and `height' in struct _DilloPrefs.

That's all... hope you like it (I did, don't have to keep resizing
dillo no more!)

best regards,

Once again:

URLs don't have entities (as the URI/URL rfc say), but when
dealing with:

<A HREF=">

in a SGML context, "A" becomes an element "HREF" an atribute
and " the atribute value.

Entities must be parsed inside atributes values.

If you don't believe me, read [HTML 4.01 Appendix B 2.2]

BTW: I just updated the home site and added a new link: MISC.
It will drive you to a handful of useful locations (including
docs, reading, etc; just click it!)


Finally, today I tried three times to upload the 0.3.1 version
to SourceForge, but it didn't work. Also checked the FTP incoming
directory and found a huge list of uploaded SW (guess there're
lots of people with the same problem).


Have a nice Christmas and hope to see you before 2001.

No stress man! 8^)
Just for curiosity, what types of mistakes come up? What kind of
reviewing to you wish us to perform to make your work easier? (I mean,
what are the most common errors?)
What I do is after making a patch, get a clean copy from CVS and apply
my patch to it, and see if everything ok... besides always strinving
to maintain clean codes.

Not specific to URLs at all, honestly! It is specific to attributes
containing literal character data, though, although we don't actually deal
with any others yet, I think.

A bit messy, that would replace entites throughout the entire tag, which is
not desirable as not even every type (although we treat them the same for
now) of attribute allows entities.

It would likely work in all cases (use of an ampersand elsewhere in tags
would be extremely uncommon, even though it is allowed), but that's not the
point.

Well in that case, a possible patch is at:

Humm. I've been thinking about this patch, and what it does is parse
entities in ALL attributes strings. Does anybody know if THAT's
correct or is entity parsing only allowed in URL's? (Don't mean to

Uh, no. URLs don't have entities in them, it's attributes (SGML sense) that
have entities. Parsing entities in URLs would be a dire mistake.

Re: [Dillo-dev]Entity parsing in links

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2000-12-23 13:02

Hi everyone!


Once upon a time ;-) there was BUG#95 (Entities parsing within
URLs) and now there's BUG#114 (basically the same), and a lot of
email and doc-research had been done.

The fact is somewhat complicated and although I explained it
before, when re-reading my post I found it less clear to follow
than when writing it.
I hope this new explanation to be better...


* The URL (URI) RFCs don't say a word about entities. The only
escaping mechanism allowed there is hexadecimal (i.e. %xx
sequences). So according to this source, they MUST NOT be parsed.

* Up to HTML 3.2 this wasn't an issue, so no clue was found
here (AFAIK).

* When HTML (4.0 or 4.1) was reformulated as a SGML
application, the entities-parsing problem sprung-in. It wasn't
there until this point. SGML say they MUST be parsed. And the URL
rfc says that characters MUST be escaped according to the context
in which they're used.
So, URLs may have entities in them, and we should parse
them.


This problem is BUG#114.


Jorge.-

Well, I have the FTP-plugin code here in my machine, and is
time to put some work on it. The problem I face is that my todo
list is always bigger than the time I have, so the only solution
is to work on a priority basis.

[Dillo-dev]Bug #71

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2000-12-23 07:08

Hi there,

I started to track down bug #71 today. It's the one that when you
have a HTML as the source of an image then that HTML title gets the
window's title.

I spent more than an hour going over IO/MIME/Callback
code... Congratulations on whoever made this IO system, it's pretty
nice! Ok, then I finally found out what the problem was. After we make
the image request, when the document arrives there is a MIME lookup to
see which callback to use to handle the incoming stuff. If we have an
HTML then it's classified as text/html, which is ok.

But the problem is that mime already calls text/html callback, which
is `a_Html_text()' (html.c). And then that will set the callback to
`Html_callback' and start "rendering" the HTML in the page (but we
don't see anything expect for the window's title changing), and we
were only expecting an image...

The solution I've implemented is to verify in `a_Html_text' is the
DilloWeb->flags is actually a WEB_RootUrl, if it's not just bail out.

For you guys that are "Dillo-oldies", is there anything wrong in
what I'm proposing? Should I initialize `html' in that function, waste
some time/space, but cleanly exit, or return NULL, saving that
time/space, but get a GTK_CRITICAL_ASSERT warning? Right now I chose
the first option.

The patch is really small (3 lines of code), you can get at:
http://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/bug_71.diff
but I'm sending it below.

Oh, since I've looked though all the IO code carefully, I was
thinking of adding a FTP handler in Dillo... do we have an interest
for adding this support? Is there any other method that anyone wants
supported? (Should I spend my time doing this stuff, or does anyone
think there are more "pressing" issues to finish first?).

Oops your right! Really sorry about that. There are two messages in the
archive concerning that, seems that this was a deleted "bug" (#95):

http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/702/2000/11/0/4658162/
http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/702/2000/11/0/4701809/

I should of read the archives... I think I assumed the Sourceforge
wouldn't be wrong in making HTML...

Jorge, when you have time, please delete bug #114 (the one I've
inserted). 

By the way, since version 0.3.1 is out, do you strip out the bugs
with smileys on them (the `done` fixes)? Or do you keep them on for a
while, so everyone knows hows Dillo's developing?

PS: Just for the hell of it, I'm sending in a patch against today's
0.3.1 version that enables entity parsing in attributes...

Hi,

I tryed to make a new release today(dillo-0.3.1), but
sourceforge servers didn't work. They claim to be under DDOS
atacks and it seems to be true :-)

I'll try again tomorrow. The new version is in the CVS though.

That's not true at all : urls don't have entities parsing mecanism. The
only parsing for urls is escaping with % HEX HEX. '&' is a reserved
character for separating 'name=value' blocks in an url.
Unfortunatly, a few sites use entities in their urls, and some browsers
(nestcape at least) allow this (but netscape's entities parsing is
admitedly broken).
This issue have already been discussed a few weeks ago in the list,
please read the archives for more details

We're wrong, according to the specifications, character entities are allowed
in attributes, and therefore '&amp;' *must* be used in place of just '&'.

It's not just links, it's all string attributes.

[Dillo-dev]Entity parsing in links

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2000-12-22 03:07

Hi yall,

I'm not sure this is a Dillo bug yet, so that's why I haven't added
it to the bug-track. Does any one know if entities (like &gt; &nbsp;
&amp;) are supposed to be parsed in links (<a href=XXX>).

I was browsing through Dillo's CVS, looking in the Changelog, at:
http://cvs.so....net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/dillo/ChangeLog?cvsroot=dillo

And I clicked on `annotate` for revision 1.19, then I got an
error. If you look at that page's source you can see that the link is:
<a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/dillo/ChangeLog?annotate=1.19&amp;cvsroot=dillo">annotate</a>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

And that's exactly what Dillo sends, but Netscape, p.e, parses
`&amp;' into a `&'. So what is the correct action to perform? Is Dillo
wrong or is Sourceforge wrong?

Yes that's right! That's the whole problem with the bookmark menu
issue. You can't attach the same menubar to more than one menu... the
solution will have to be to create a new menubar widget... ok. But
current `Bookmarks_goto_bookmark` (the callback from choosing a
particular bookmark menuitem), sees if the selected widget is equal to
the first created one... that won't work. A fix for this would be to
pass the widget's index from `DilloBookmark bookmark[]`.

But then we get another problem, we also need the browserwindow, or
else we won't know which *bw should we give to a_Nav_push().

So we need to pass the callback two arguments, but GTK only supports
callbacks with one argument (actually two, but the first you don't
choose, it's always the GTK_OBJECT which generated the event
signal). The solution GTK recommends for this (which is the obvious
one), is to create a struct with the desired fields and pass a pointer
to the struct.

That's what I'm doing now (actually, I'm not since I'm in the middle
of final exams and they're *killing* me...), but I'll get to it at the
end of this week. That's why I'm was asking about where to place the
struct.

So does `put it in bookmark.c` win?

PS: What about the make new window the same size as the current one?
Did you finally get to resolving that?

That would be very nice. What about a cookierc (text) file containing

Hi all,

I'm working on bug #110 (the bookmarks menu not appearing in
new window) and was checking for the best way to fix this. I figured
that all have to create a struct with a pointer to a menuitem (or an
array index) and a pointer to the bw, and pass that struct to the
callback (it really doesn't matter for now). What I want to get to, is
where should I put (define) this new struct?

I've seen that DilloBookmark is defined in browser.h, but should it
be there at all? Because that's a struct that has no interest for the
other modules, not even BrowserWindow, it is only used in
bookmark.c. Since no other module should know, or need to know, what
is a DilloBookmark, I suggest we take it out of browser.h and put it
in bookmark.h (and I even dare say bookmark.c). And the struct that
I'll create? I guess it should go in bookmark.c, since it is not
interesting for other modules including bookmark.h to know? Or should
I put it in bookmark.h, for cleanliness sake?

I personally really dislike cookies. I only accept them when they're
really necessary for some service (like when `logging in` at
Sourceforge's web site). I would really like a finer control over
ccokies than what Netscape 4.X gives me. 

Netscape 6, for example, has a type of "cookie manager", where you
can define a rule (accept always, accept never) for each separate
URL. I thought it very good. So I enabled cookies from sourceforge and
disabled for the rest of the world...

I would like Dillo to have something similar, a "cookie manager"
with flexible rules for accepting/denying cookies for diferent
sites. Maybe this manager could be integrated as a plugin...

Any ideas?

Hi,

Dillo 0.3.1 is almost ready for a release; most probably by
December 22. It is a very nice upgrade, you'll appreciate...
In the mean time, SourceForge made the move to their new
servers, but the download counters problem remain :( Just checked
a few projects and no one got their file-hits right... Anyway,
dillo-0.3.1 will be there before Christmas.

Sometime ago Sebastian suggested a font-factor; that's a very
good idea to implement. A single number in dillorc that scales
font sizes (a flash skim through html.c showed that you'll have
to search some hard coded font-size numbers within the code to
implement it; not hard though!).

-----
[Cookies]

J=F6rgen submitted a patch a long time ago. It's not complete and
the unimplemented part is the cookie sending one. This patch has
been procrastinated due to:

a) priorities
b) the url-passing scheme needs a new implementation

Currently, POST and GET do some url-string hacking to get their
data to the IO part, and then to the remote server. Cookies need
to send some information too, and the same happens with
authentication.

This is basically a matter of defining a Url structure and
passing it to a lot of functions. The complex part is that
there're lots of functions that expect a URL string, there're
several workarounds, some hacks also, and last but not the least:
dillo's code is very tight and dependent on URLs (they are used
as primary Keys in the cache for instance, and several decisions
are being made in the URL passing chain from one module into
another).

Ah, there's also the problem of URL normalization in between.

[Dillo-dev]Fontsize

From: Bruno Widmann <bwidmann@ut...> - 2000-12-15 15:27

Hi,

I have a rather small monitor, and for my taste dillo
displays text in a fontsize too small. It would be nice if 
you could change fonts/fontsizes in the ~/.dillo/dillorc file.

I had a look around the sources, and found that in html.c
the fontsize seems to be hardcoded.

in Html_page_check there is

font.size = 12;

and in Html_tag_open_h there is

gint sizes[] = {24, 18, 18, 14, 12, 10}

which sets fontsizes for text under <H1> - <H6>

I have allready played around with prefs.c/h and it's quite 
simple to add config items there so that you can change these values
via dillorc.

But I don't know if this is the "right way" to do it.
Or maybe thers something else planed for fonthandling? If it's ok
to add these values to the configfiles i could submit a patch.

[Dillo-dev]Bug #109 <font> tag

Hi,


Please note that when making the bug-track entry for FONT

more, when he finally found out that there was someone else
working on it, he apologized gently (even though it was not his
fault), and offered his help. --meus parabÃªns pro senhor.

BUGs are not owned: there's a explicit recommendation to those
interested in helping the developer that first took them, to
contact him and to offer any help.

Oops! Sorry for the mix up, you're right. I checked the mailing

Would you like me to change the bug-track entry so that the being
`worked on` field points to you? (Of course, you can do it yourself if
you want, it's but #109).

I'll discontinue with my version, since your's is probably much

Hum... strange. But surelly Dillo will have an option 
`Render it just like the author intended to be', will it not? I mean,
it's really nice to have a very flexible rendering system, so the
client can do all his heart's will, but sometimes the client's heart's
is willing to see it like the author intended... and then you'd be
taking away flexibility...

before anything I would like to say that I really don't want to

you out, like you've always done for me. So sorry if I still disagree
with you, but I think this kind of stuff is worth discussing so that
we ALL can learn from (specially me, who knows too little...). If I'm
being a pest about this issue, let me know and I'll drop it, ok?

With that said let's get to more interesting issues ;-)

Ok, I've thought a little bit more about this and I think that both
solutions are ok. But my solution seems easier for bug #96 and your
solution to the "opening new same sized window" problem (or maybe
not... read on).

Let me see if I understand correctly this problem ... To use my
solution on to implement this you'll have to connect a signal to a
callback with two arguments: (1 = the clicked link, 2= the clicked bw,
to extract the size). But this is already handled in
Dw_page_handle_event... and then it calls
a_Commands_open_link_nw_callback with the bw that was CLICKED by the
user... (isn't this what you wanted?). So, theoretically, all you'd
have to is get the size from the `bw` in
a_Commands_open_link_nw_callback and pass it to a modified
a_Interface_new_browser_window which takes the size as arguments...

Sorry, if am still missing the point... but it still seems needless
to have the last_clicked_bw. I think it is totally feasible to use my
solution... hum, let me see...

<Sometime passes .... >

Ok, I have a patch here that opens new windows the same size as the
parent window the call came from (wether from the menu `New Window`,
or clicking with button 2, or clicking with button 3 and selecting
`Open Link in new window`). Are looking to this something similar?

The patch is in:
http://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/new_window_same_size.diff

If you want I can e-mail it to you personally, so I wouldn't
generate extar traffic on the list. Hope this helps you on what you're

Yeah, you might be right, I lack lots of expericence. I'm still a

About SIZE, each browser is free to render it as it likes, so your idea
of multiplying by 4 is good. 
Let me propose something : make new dillorc parameters for these (say
default_font_size and default_font_step)

[Dillo-dev]Bug #109 (<font> tag)

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2000-12-10 05:43

Hi yall,

I've included bug #109 into the bug-track, when I was looking at a
teacher's page when I noticed that some colored text wasn't colored
:-( So I checked the src/html.c, func Html_tag_open_font, and I saw:

#if 0
<some_stuff>
#endif
Html_push_tag(...)

Does anyone know/remember why this was commented out? Well it didn't
work anyway, so I started to see if I could get the <font> tag
working. After sometime I got a pretty good working version (it still
has a small render bug, but I think it's pretty much working). I
checked http://www.w3.org to see the qualifiers for the tag <font>, they are:
`face', `size' and `color'. So those are the one I've implemented.

The current patch is in:
http://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/font_tag.diff

It will corretly render HTML like:
http://www.rti-zone.org/dillo/Html.testsuite/color.html
or
http://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/font-test.html


The patch will change two files: src/html.c and src/colors.c.
There is are two small issues that are pending so I can get this patch
100% done.

1) `size=absolute' or `size=[+-]relative'. 
What W3 says is that we should accept 8 font sizes (numbered from
1-7), but in Dillo we have more granularity, ending up with more
numbered sizes (at least 24, which is in the <h1> tag). So how should
I deal with this? In my patch I multiply html size value by 4, giving
us Dillo size value... of course this isn't the "right" way to convert
from font numbering. Anybody has any ideas?

2) a_Color_parse issues...

There are two issues which I've encountered:

i) color="Aqua" doesn't resolve to anything! It should resolve to
"aqua" == 0x00ffff, shouldn't it? This issue seems to me like a
Dillo bug... To fix this I changed all words to their lower-case
representation. I did this with:
> for (i = 0; i < strlen(subtag); i++)
> subtag[i] = tolower(subtag[i]);
Is there a better/more efficient way of doing this?

ii) color="ff00aa"
To read a color as a hex number Dillo requires a "0x" or "#"
prefix, but I've found many html's with just color="56abf3", or
something like this. Currently, to fix this, I did something
TOTALLY wrong! Just checked if (strlen(subtag) == 6). To only
real fix which I thought of was to run over `subtag' string
checking if all chars are valid hex digits [0-9a-fA-F]. Any body
know someway better to do this?

I think that's all my doubts for now... and ideas/critics/support
are always supported,

bye,

Hum, you noticed the question mark. We could change the name for
last_clicked_bw, if you think it's less confusing.
What we really need is CLICKED, so our popup menus (which can be used
only when _click_ing) know what bw we're talking about.

*cough*
"unclean" is a dangerous concept : it makes you think the code is more
important that the application.
"maybe unclean" is even worse : it makes you think the same while
admitting you didn't investigate the problem.

(don't get me wrong : I'm not advocating dirty-but-cool hacks, I'm more
like Jorge's "don't over-optimize" topic)

> 

Well, that's actually why I made this proposal : your solution can't be
applied to my problem ;-)
But I though mine would solve both (and probably more) at the same time,
so it can have some good in it.

(since your want more infos, I needed to know the size and position of
the window that was clicked to open a new window and smartly adjust its
geometry)

VALUE is a requiered attribute for CHECKBOXES (and RADIO). We're talking
here about how to deal with faulty tag missing requiered attributes,
which is not uncommon in web pages.
Browsers have a different behavior :
- Dillo sends "name="
- Netscape and Amaya send "name=on"
- Opera sends nothing (but renders the checkbox, which is the worse case
IMHO)
- (IE not tested)

PS: another FORM related issue : the SUBMIT button's value is not
POSTed by Dillo. It should.

Well I check it out. It *seems* to me that the coordinates from the
Logical Screen Descriptor are in fact ignorable, but I'm not
absolutely sure. Here is the part that matters from the GIF
specification:

**************************************

Virtual-screen? Printer? It seems to me that it's ignorable, and we
can really just rely on the coordinates from the Image
Descriptor. Here's the spec info on the Image Descriptor:

*************************************

Well can anybody who's a better english speaker and has more image
knowledge tell me if I'd doing something wrong in ignoring the Logical
Screen Descriptor's coordinates? I think it's okay, specially after
reading this spec and reading xloadimage-4.1 source code (it ignores
it too).

If there are no objections, then the patch I have completely fixes
bug #98.. just have to clean it up a bit before sending it in...

Any feedback is appreciated, best regards to all,

Nice work. I've seen that you've updated CVS versions twice after
the 0.3.0 release. That's really nice, cause we can see dillo change
dinamically and not in big jumps like before, hope you keep this
up. If you do intend to keep updating CVS with certain frequency, then
may I suggest a dillo-cvs-log@so...? I don't know how it's
done, but I've seen other projects do this, and I thoght it really
neat. Everytime someone (you) makes a CVS check-in, then the list

It's not 90% anymore ;-) Yes I have finished! I put 90% cause I was

anything better design, so I think it's good enough. I haven't changed

[Dillo-dev]Comments

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2000-12-09 19:17

Hi,


Well, it seems that dillo is getting better and improving
faster than before. The patch queue is also being flooded at a
higher rate and from different persons. I'm very happy with this,
and also spent a lot of time integrating the patches; you'll
notice in the Changelog that almost no patch got clean into the
sources, I had to rework most of them; please be more careful
before submitting.

Maybe that's due to what I call "the rush effect": when a
developer gets into a coding task and hasn't made the entry in
the bug track, he gets eager to finnish before any one else does.
Please avoid this situation (Yes, I received repeated patches,
and had to make some bug-track-entries myself to stop it).

On the other hand, the big patch queue was very interesting
and after integration has made --no doubt!-- a better dillo;
Thanks everybody.

Yes, there's enough material for making a new release, I just
want to test it some more, add a few improvements, wait for
sourceforge's counters to start working again and it'll be there.


Jorge.-

Not necessary. There are simpler ways to check which window is 
focused, but in this case, you indeed want to get the last window the 
user had clicked into, not the focus window (and a window manager 
*does not need* to focus this window). Another way would be to store 
the browser window belonging to the page into the popup menu, just 
before popping it up.

However, I'd prefer Livius' implementation, there is really no need 
to make the code kludgier as needed just to save little memory 
(compared to the memory anyway allocated for a browser window).

[Dillo-dev]About bug #98 (GIF especification?)

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2000-12-09 17:02

Hi all!

Since I went trough the png test suite, I couldn't help noticing the
http://www.rti-zone.org/dillo/Html.testsuite/badgif.html, where
there's a gif that's not drawn correctly. I've found the problem and
made a patch to fix this, but I'm not sure I'm doing the "correct"
thing to fix it... but my fix doesn't seem to break any other GIFs.

The problem is that gif->width and gif->height are supposed to be
read from 2 distinct places. From the Logical Screen Descriptor 
(where:
gif->Width = LM_to_uint(buf[0], buf[1]); 
gif->Height = LM_to_uint(buf[2], buf[3]);
)

*and* from the Image Descriptor
(where:
gif->Width = LM_to_uint(buf[4], buf[5]);
gif->Height = LM_to_uint(buf[6], buf[7]);
)

Currently Dillo is only reading it's width and height from the
Logical Screen Descritor. I've checked sources from gif2png and
xloadimage (xview), and they seem to respect only the Image Descriptor
width and height, and almost ignore and coordinates from Logical
Screen Desc (which is kind of strange). So what I've done is just
that, I don't call a_Dicache_set_parms from within Gif_get_descriptor,
but call it with the "correct" values from Gif_do_img_desc. This seems
to work fine with all GIF's and should work with all GIF's are
open-able(?) with xloadimage. (oh the patch is at:
http://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/bad_gif.diff).

But I want to make sure I'm doing the correct thing... So does
anybody know where I can find an GIF especification? Or like GIF-RFC?
IS there a GIF especification at all for public eyes? If I could get
one, them I could really make sure that my patch is full proof.

best regards,

Like I wrote in the previous e-mail, I've made each bw have it's own
menu_pop, i.e. make menu_pop a member of the struct
_BrowserWindow. This way the signal was corretly assigned to the right
bw. Personally, I think this is a clean fix, which doesn't require a
lot of rework, and seems to be robust. This way we don't have to worry
which is the focused or clicked window, since GTK deals corretly with
this when we connect the signal (right_button on bw -> open menu_pop).

Humm.. this could work too. But I think this solution is a little
more complex. Not necessarilly, in all window managers/systems, does
clicked == focused. I think we might have a long and tiresome battle
to get all the cases where the window is focused, so the topmost_bw is
always correct and accurate. I don't know, but it seems too tricky to
get this to work out, and maybe "unclean"...

What do you need this info (focused window) for? Could you use the
solution I've made for your problem too? Maybe I can help out...

How did you eventually manage the problem ? 
I had a similar problem, needing to know what was the last clicked (==
focused ?) window. The solution I used would help both of us, I think. I
added a global variable in dillo.c :
BrowserWindow *topmost_bw;
This variable is updated in dw_page.c, GDK_BUTTON_PRESS event.

I digged into my archive and didn't find them :(
(I surely had been so dissapointed that ...!)

Anyway, I was using mph-1.2.tar.gz (22 Kb), an excellent
package for generating minimal perfect hashes. Once you find a
function, it can be tuned in steps and table size, very cool
stuff. I remember that I built a hash function for every
supported HTML tag in dillo, and tuned it to half the size and 2
or three steps; it was faster than the binary search, sure (4% or
so), but the added complexity, was not worth the trouble.

Yes, since '/' is not allowed in host names, I'd say this is a good 
idea.

Another idea: With all the plugins in future, how about a common 
scheme based on regular expressions, configured by the user, e.g:

/^ftp\.[[:alnum:]\.]+\// -> ftp:// (assuming that ftp server names
often begin with "ftp.")
/^[[:alnum:]\.]+\// -> http://
/^\// -> file:
/^\(.+\)/ -> info:
/^\w+\(\w+\)$/ -> man:

That's too bad dillo's having a different behavior when getting a URL
in the command line or in the nav bar. Should be the same.

No negfault for me either. I think it's the same bug with interrupting
download again. I'm pretty sure whoever made this entry can't reproduce
it every time.
IMHO there should be a <b>big</b> warning on the bug insertion page
asking people to test _several_ time the how-to-reproduce method before
they submit.

I think I'm begining to see the light ;-) What I understand now is when
registering a call-back, the parameter (bw) is registered too. I though
the parameter was updated according to the calling widget each time the
callback was invoked (&bw).
... I should really read this gkt book I bought a while ago ;-)

Hello again,

Since I'm crowding too much this list lately I'll send in a 3 in 1
e-mail. Here goes my three topics:

1)
Just wanted to write to say I've completely finished the png
transparency implementation. Including the gamma correction which I
didn't implement in the previous patch. So with that I think that the
PNG test suite on Eric's site is pretty much complete, or have I
skipped something?

2)
Sometime ago I sent in a patch to correct, what I considered, a
misbehaviour, but since nobody said anything (neither against or in
favor), I'll ask again. When I type in the following in Dillo:

/home/livio/

Dillo will then try to resolve http://home/livio/, but that isn't what
I wanted him to do. Im my opinion Dillo should consider URL's starting
with a '/' (slash) as a file request. What do you guys think?

I've made a patch to do exactly this. It's small, check it out at:
http://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/file.diff

3)
I tried to reproduce bug #107, but I failed. If anyone on the list
registered bug 107, could you please explain how to reproduce it, so I
may that a llok at it?

that's about all, see yall latter,

Well I'll try to explain it in my bad english...

Since there was only one (global) `menu_popup`, everytime a new
window was opened the same menu_popup would be (re)initialized (in
a_Menu_popup_new). In that initialization the Menu_add (to connect a
signal to a callback function), would be written over with the new
parameter (the new *bw). So when the signal (event) called the
callback, it would send the latest *bw NOT the current *bw.

Ummm, did it get any clearer, or just confused you more?

Ok, I agree that sometimes it can be annoying and waste of
bandwidght to have all patches attached to the list. I should of
thought of having my patches on a web page before :-(

Here is a link to all the patches which I've made (or am currently
working on):

http://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/

It's my homepage from the University. It is REALLY slow, and
sometimes the University has it's backbone down and won't respond at
all. If anyone is trying to get a particular patch they can e-mail me
and ask, I'll be happy to provide it.

I've pretty much finished, and you can get it at:

But I will sent it to you personally.

I've tried it out, and the patch I've made fixes the problem with
`Save link as...` too. The patch is here:

he was talking about a minimal perfect hash function, not a hash
function robust for cryptography purposes. 
However, I tested the the glib hash function for strings, and it's not
good _at_all_ : not near perfect (lots of collisions, any XOR-based
function is better). Almost unsuable.

Doesn't glib include one? At least the header file suggests so. There
are several function declarations named 'g_hash_table_*()'. So, this
might be worth looking into.

canÂ´t wait till tables are supported by dillo.

keep up the good work!!!

I had a quick look at the sources, and I don't understand why passing bw
isn't enough for finding what page was clicked.
However, I know the bug is there : _I_ did the bugtrack entry !

one thing I was taught was to profile, profile, profile. There is a nice GNU
tool called gprof to help with this. You compile the app with profiling turned
on, run it, then run gprof on the output (gmon.out I think). You get a
function call tree, time spent in each, etc. Very useful.

I don't have an absolute answer for this question.
Cartainly, final-patches must be sent to me for revision and
inclusion, but those that can be considered as a "work in
progress" can be sent to the list for discussion.

This mailing list has a reputation (gained over time) to be low
traffic and interesting, and I love it that way; maybe the best
way is hold patches while still polishing them and only request
some help or feedback when you really need it. Posting the patch
is a last resource, cause you always have the chance to send it
privately to the helping party.

Eric found a good solution by publishing pre-patches in his web
site, maybe you can ask him for some space when necessary.

Thanks for the info.

BTW: Does anyone remember BUG#95? (Whether or not to parse
entities within URIs) I answered that sometime ago but, ....!!!,
my last research showed that although the URI RFC doesn't mention
entities, when the w3c guys decided to define HTML as SGML,
the entities parsing problem sprung-in, and the recomendation is
to parse them!!! (HTML 4.01 Appendix B 2.2).

I don't if they changed the recommendation when they decided to
put-off SGML and defined XHTML as XML :-)

Please send me your last patch (when done) Livio.


> [Code optimization]

Eric's suggestions can be very insightful. I just want to add
my two-cents.

The University told us that code optimization was a task to be
undertaken by the compiler (mainly peephole opt.), the real world
is different!

Some time ago I made some local vars optimizations that yielded
a bit more than a 100% percent speed gain!!!!! (with gcc :-).
When I exposed the problem to one of the gcc-tester's team, he
couldn't believe his eyes.

Finally, never try to over-optimize!!!

Speed opt. is a highly tricky matter. For instance, what seems
faster in theory doesn't always show on reality: sometime ago I
was tunning a minimal perfect hash function for dillo, and I
succeeded!, but profiling revealed that the gain over a simple
binary search was around 2%, and the added complexity was
impressive.


> [BUG #96]

I'll answer this one when I look up the patch code. I'm
interested cause a similar problem arises when trying to get the
link the mouse was over at click time (for "Save link as").

It's very nice. It's probably faster than the original code too.
BTW, testing for 0 and 255 is a very nice optimisation over
png_composite : as these values are more likely to be used, you avoid
calling a function.

Isn't there a gamma-init function in pnglib ?
Anyway, IMHO we should all make more bugtrack entries, even for such
tiny problems, so we don't forget them. Jorge can always remove it if he
thinks it's not important.

No, that's how it's done. Perhaps png->width can be calculated outside,
but it shouldn't matter much.
If it wasn't image processing (we're talking about hundred thousands
pixels, one loop for each pixel), I wouldn't suggest the following
(since i is not used) :
for ( i = png->width ; i ; i-- )
;-)))

Last thing : you've probably reviewed the gif decoding to learn how
transparency is delt with. Do you think the code is optimised enough ?

[Dillo-dev]Bug #96

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2000-12-01 04:21

Attachments: menu_pop.diff      

Hi!

I started working on patch number 96. It was the bug that when
trying to `View Source` with multiple windows open, Dillo would always
get the last opened window and view that source, no matter on what
window we clicked. First I went to look for the source of the problem,
it appears to be the fact the the is only Menu_popup for all the
windows. And when we open a new window using
a_Interface_new_browser_window, we re-initilialize menu_popup, with:

> menu_popup.menu = a_Menu_popup_new(bw);
> menu_popup.menu_over_link = a_Menu_popup_ol_new(bw);

And in a_Menu_popup_new we add the callback for selecting View
Source, and all other Menu_popup entries. So for every new window, the
callback are changed to look up it's data from that window, ignoring
the possibility of other older windows...

So I have thought up of two solutions, and for the first one I'm
sending in the patch which I've made (almost minimal changes to
current program):

1) One solution is to have every window have it's own menu_popup. So
basically I changed struct _BrowserWindow to include a
DillowMenuPopup, and changed all ocurrences of menu_popup tp
bw->menu_popup. This is the solution I've implemented and am sending
the patch.

2) The other soluion would involve more changes to current code, but
might be more economic. Instead of having each BrowserWindow have it's
own menu_popup like in (1), continue like current code, having a
global menu_poup, but use the browser_window[] Vector(? array?) index
to pass to the callback. So when the callback is called it checks,
somehow, from what window is the signal coming from and them access
the window using the browser_window[] array. I didn't like this idea
so much as it would make the code uglier and even though we would
economize a mune_popup per new window, we would create overhead to
find out from what window was the signal coming from and process that
information accordingly.


Any ideas/comments? I would really apreciate, since I still haven't
convinced myself I've chosen the right choice (or there may be
others...). 

Oh, and the patch is supposed to be applyied over the whole dillo
directory (from CVS), but will only affect: src/bookmark.c,
src/browser.h, src/commands.c, src/dw_page.c, src/interface.c,
src/menu.c. 

best regards to all,

Gee, thanks, Eric!

Very nice tips you gave on my patch (some of the stuff I already
knew but was too lazy/sleepy to get things out). Sorry about the
newbie code... but with all of your suggestions, now I think the patch
is looking good...

By the way, I also had forgotten to add an "composite" support, for
when alpha value is between 0 (fully transparent) and 255 (totally
opaque). I'm sending the new version, look at it and see if it's more
'decent' or is it still crappy? (Am sending it attached...)

Oh and I also checked the PNG test suite and compared against
netscape 6 for Linux. The only thing that was different was the gamma
correction. I guess there isn't any gamma correction with current PNG
in dillo. Maybe I'll to do that some other time. Meanwhile, should I
put such small problem in the bug-track, or should I leave it alone,
hence it's "kind" of documented in the test suite?

I agree completely, loops are what makes the code have a higher
complexity, and everything that can, should be put outside of the
loop.

Well... how is it now? Less uglier?

I still have a doubt though. I currently left alone the outer for:
for (i = 0; i < png->width; i++) {
but just to acknowledge when to stop, cause I don't use `i` anywhere
else. Do you see a better way to detect when png is over with.
