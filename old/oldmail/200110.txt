Granted, but i wonder just how many extra cycles or memory usage is added,
i doubt it's that much at all, probabbly less then is needed to fork off

I'm sure you'll understand the unix way in building applications about
the same time you learn how to quote other people on mailing lists.
Answers should be below the original text and irrelevant text should be
removed. There are rfc:s defining this and, most important, it really
helps the readers.

The main bad thing with having that extra code in the browser is that it
adds cpu cycles and memory usage to normal browsing sessions. How often
do you actually view a page source code? Except for when developing web
browsers of course. Do you view 1% of the pages? Or perhaps on out of
1000? Most users never ever view the source. There's normally no need
to.

It's not the web browsers job. It shouldn't be there. It adds bloat to
the browser, and other applications problary does a better job.

hmmm... looks like the current viewer *doesn't* spawn a new process. (unless

Agreed. It's my hope to one day get Dillo working on my Agenda PDA,
and I imagine viewing HTML source won't be too important for most users,
so saving some room in the binary is nice.

Having options for an external viewer (whether it be an 'official Dillo'
one, or simply "rxvt -e more %s") is the best way to go to keep the
program small.

Of course, if we just /must/ have a built-in viewer (it's hard to imagine,
but there might be some environments where a text viewer like 'more'
or something like a 'notepad' program would NOT be available),
I think it should be pretty simple. Just a scrollable, fixed-point font
plaintext display. No colors or anything.

I know. :) it's a waste of space in a program that's designed to be tiny. 
if I actually knew how to write C, I might just take the viewer and make it
a separate project. 
oh well... one of these days. :)

[Dillo-dev]Yay! Cookies!

From: Lars Clausen <lrclause@cs...> - 2001-10-31 17:06

I now have (rudimentary) cookie support. While I can parse all the RFC2109
cookies and the old Netscape style cookies, some servers seem to be very
picky about the format. I got the bulletin boards that I've really been
missing cookies for to accept them. There is no cookie control yet, nor
persistent storage, and the cookie jar is shared among all threads.

For those who'd like to try it out, a tarball with a patch and two new
files is at <URL:http://shasta.cs.uiuc.edu/~lrclause/dillo-cookies.tar.gz>.

I shall now start to consider how to control them:) I'd like to avoid
blocking the page load while asking about cookies, so that should go into a
separate thread.=20=20

Persistance would require a lock, because of the threading, otherwise it's
trivial.=20

Yes, I can reproduce it, you may have to click the reload
button. However, I'm currently rewriting (for bug #201) the code in
dw_page.c for word wrapping, size requisition and some other things,
the code has become a bit clearer, and indeed, this bug does not occur
in my code. So I've committed myself to this bug.

that's actually a good idea; and should be an option. (like it is in

The reason I'm interested in re-inventing the wheel in this case, is that
our new wheel might be smaller and ligher than the old wheel. :)

[Dillo-dev]Multiple header fields

From: Lars Clausen <lrclause@cs...> - 2001-10-30 21:57

Hi again!

As I mentioned earlier, I'm working on code for cookies (not nearly as hard
as I thought). I have the basic cookie matching and aging down, and I'm
now starting on parsing cookies. I've found one problem in the way the
HTTP header is parsed, though: AFAICT, the Cache_parse_field function
assumes that there is only one field with a particular header. However,
RFC 2109 states that 'An origin server may include multiple Set-Cookie
headers in a response'. I'm not too happy to hack in such a central
place, so I hope somebody knowledgeable in this area can come up with a
good solutions.

#241 would be the same old problem with the last line of a page not

I think biting the bullet and do a comparison on every word added will

[Dillo-dev]Big tag-parsing patch

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2001-10-30 12:56

Hi everyone!


As some of you may know, we were working very hard with J=F6rgen
on the new TAG-parsing code (it was priority #1). The good news
is that it's already in the CVS!
Please consider it beta and test it as much as possible (any
page will do!). C'mon, GO GET IT! ;)


What does it do:

* Eliminates fixed-size attribute constraints!
* A single pass for getting attribute values and entities
parsing.
* Avoids g_strdup whenever is possible.
* Parses CDATA as stated in the W3C's HTML4.01 standar:
- replaces named entities with LATIN1 char codes
- replaces numeric character entities with LATIN1 char codes
- ignores LF
- replaces CR and TAB with a single space
Note: Entities outside Latin1 are still pending.

* Fixes: BUG#190, BUG#197, BUG#207, BUG#228 and BUG#239.

[Dillo-dev]interface visibility patch

From: Sam J. <mail@sa...> - 2001-10-26 00:38

Attachments: dillo-0.6.2-visibility.diff.gz      

In an effort to get some of my ipaq changes integrated to main dillo I've 
made a patch against 0.6.2 that allows you to configure which interface 
widgets (such as toolbar buttons) are visible. This is great on handhelds and 
possibly embedded systems where typing in the url should not be allowed.

Next I'll try to make the mouse buttons configurable. I've just now 
discovered that you can pan the viewport with the middle button, and it would 
help a lot when viewing pages on the ipaq.

I would like this feature to be more elegantly implemented. At least to
where you can set generally what browser to look like, from the
preferences.

[Dillo-dev]Dillo pretending to be IE

From: Andreas Schweitzer <andy@ph...> - 2001-10-25 22:53

Hi,

First of all : Great work guys ! I like dillo a lot !

Now, after M$ latest stunt : 
http://slashdot.org/articles/01/10/25/1824206.shtml
I decided I needed to hack dillo :-) Not that I visit MSN nor that
I think MSN is in any way worth visiting .... but still ....
this is not the first time something like that happened.

Here is a patch that makes dillo pretend to be IE. Right now,
this is only for MSN. But if you like it I may make it more
elegantly.

Cheers
Andreas

[Dillo-dev]Charset (and font) problem solving etc.

From: Grigory Bakunov <black@as...> - 2001-10-23 02:08

Okey, i solve some font troubles in dillo.
As you remember after long debates in dillo code apear
some 'ugly hacked solution' for font selecting - i mean direct font charset setting like this -
sprintf (fontname, "-*-%s-%s-%s-*-*-%d-*-75-75-*-*-iso8859-1",...);
i make a patch for solve it - now all this strings changed to
sprintf (fontname, "-*-%s-%s-%s-*-*-%d-*-75-75-*-*-%s",
...,
prefs.font_charset);
and to dillorc file added new options - 
font_charset=xxx
where xxx is your prefered font charset.
by default it's equal 'iso8859-1'.

patch place here

[Dillo-dev]Suggestions

From: <digitalash@vs...> - 2001-10-19 14:55

Hello Friends,

I am Ashwin Desikan from chennai, i just downloaded the latest version of Dillo and it is great.
i would like to make a few suggestions though:

1. support for backspace key in editable textareas.
2. i think u can put the "page size" box and the "no of pages" box at the top of the tool bar to the right most bottom along with status bar. it would look better.
3. i think u can map the backspace key to back button if the control is not in a textarea.
4. u can provide a small button along with the back and forward buttons (similar to netscape and IE) wherein the list of all the previous links visited is displayed, so that the user can select the one he wants to revisit.

i am willing to contribute to the developement of dillo in whatever way possible. i would like to know if any among u have already started to support frames in dillo (i went through the minimalistic support in 0.6.2 ).

KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS

bye

Just FYI: Gtk+ 2.0 will, AFAIK, support scrolled menus, so this hack
will become obsolete.

They are in several dillo widgets:

- DwPage contains them in the word/line structure:
page->words[i].style->link; if you iterate over the lines
(e.g. for getting the vertical position), page->lines[i] contains
indices on the words list (first_word and last_word).

- DwImage contains several links for image maps, this is described
in doc/DwImage.txt in the tarball.

- Of course, a DwContainer (the base class of all widgets
containing other widgets) contains, indirectly, also links.

Probably the best is to add one or more virtual functions to the base
class DwWidget, and implement them for those three widgets.

Links are, for Dw, just numbers, the widgets just emit signals which
other modules are connected to, look e.g. at Dw_page_button_press. The
signals are the same for all widgets, and described in
doc/DwImage.txt. For activating links by the keyboard, "link_clicked"
is probably the best choice, then the function Html_link_clicked
(which is connected to this signal) has to be modified a bit,
GdkEventButton does not make much sense for this.

From: Johannes Hofmann <Johannes.Hofmann@gm...> - 2001-10-17 10:35

Hi,

I just realized that attributes actually don't need to be that large to
cause a buffer overflow.
Just try to view the following HTML page.

<html>
<head></head>
<body text="mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm">
</body>
</html>

A better crafted "text" attribute would execute arbitrary code.

Wouldn't the prefered way to run such a protocol fixer be as a proxy server?

It seems like a really bad idea to perform that task inside the browser. 
For a number of obvious reasons.

Do anyone know if there exist any proxy software that tries to parse and 
correct buggy html?

Hi grigory!

i really appreciate your detailed discussion of the problem!

it brings a question to my mind, what is the 'dillo way' to handle broken
html?

i havent been working on this project too long, so if there is an
established policy about broken html, then i'd like to see it spelled out
on the dillo project page.

can i suggest that there be a 'broken html' plugin(s)? i know that we have
discussed the broken html on ebay....but i havent heard any direction on
this issue.....

tnx!

[Dillo-dev]dillo strange behaviour

From: Grigory Bakunov <black@as...> - 2001-10-16 17:28

I found realy strange dillo behaviour on rpmfind.net site.

look - at first search we have this html:
----- HTML-phase-1 ------------------------------------
<form method="get" action="/linux/rpm2html/search.php" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
<input type="text" size="35" name="query" value=""> 
<input type="submit" value="Search ..." name="submit">
</form>
------------------------------------------------END-------

so, realy good work form. after input into 'query' field text '12345'
and press submit we pass to rpmfind.net site next url query:
http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=1234&submit=Search+...
and now form in html look like this

------- HTML-phase-2---------------------------------
<form action="/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=1234" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded" method="GET">
<input name="query" type="TEXT" size="60" value="1234">
<input name=submit type=submit value="Search ...">
</form>
------------------------------------------------END-----
As all see - authors of rpmfind site place our 'query' string into form action tag.
so, after input into query field '4321' and press submit - we have VERY strange URL string:
http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=1234?query=4321&submit=Search+...
look! we have to 'query' variable in url. but RFC says it's not correct.
and at least - we have absolutely wrong html form text -

------- HTML-phase-3---------------------------------
<form action="/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=1234%3Fquery%3D4321"
enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded" method="GET">
<input name="query" type="TEXT" size="60" value="1234?query=4321">
<input name=submit type=submit value="Search ...">
</form>
------------------------------------------------END----

so, we need to remove dublicate variables when insert new variables by GET method.
Thanks for all who be so patient and read this message to the end.

[Dillo-dev]backround colour

From: Liam <jedi@ro...> - 2001-10-16 08:19

Hey everyone,

I'm new on the dillo scene and was wondering why all backrounds that are 
supposed to be white are some sort of off-white? Is this intended?

Also, I'd like to say that it is really nice to see a browser that loads 
so fast, both for use and loading webpages.

Cheers,
Liam 



[Dillo-dev]CCC principle

From: <SirVer@gm...> - 2001-10-15 14:59

Hey there,

i implemented a kind of dpi1 plugin scheme a while ago, then, I run out
of time. Now, I'd like to try it again with the new CCC style.
But I don't fully grap the principle. Could someone explain me how it
works exactly?

Thanks

[Dillo-dev]Fix for segfault with long attributes

From: Johannes Hofmann <Johannes.Hofmann@gm...> - 2001-10-12 11:58

Hi,

in Html_get_attr_value() I found a small typo that causes an buffer
overflow in dillo when reading attribute values larger than 1024 bytes.
The attached patch fixes the problem.

I actually started looking into this and text selection the other day, they are the features I miss most in dillo.
There are no structures holding the location of the links as far as I know, currently when the mouse is moved over a link the function Dw_page_find_link is called. This function returns the contents of word->style->link (which could contain a link or not) for the word that the cursor is over.
The function itself searches the lines one by one till it matches the y position of the cursor, and then searches the words on that line one by one till the x position of the cursor is matched.

I think seerching word by word from start to end is currently the only way to find a link on a page without a reference such as the cursor position. 



[Dillo-dev]'who' in dillo 'knows' that something is a link? need this for keyboard link navigation

From: John Utz <john@ut...> - 2001-10-10 21:15

hi;

When dillo loads a page, it learns where the links are and colors them
blue.

Furthermore, when the cursor flies over a link, it is presented in the
data area at the bottom of the page.

i would like to have keyboard navigation work as simply as possible, so it
needs to make use of existing functionality so that it doesnt break/get
broken by dillo improvements.

so, what data structure maintains these link facts and what do i use to
access them?

tnx!

Well, the menu items are shortened at the moment, so you'd never need to

Yes, it needs revision. It doesn't take effect for a new page until after
the first scroll, I have no idea why. And I would like to have it not be
configurable, really, but set to slightly less than a page (if we can do
one or two lines of text less, that'd be nice for reading, but it's more
tricky).=20

I agree that heavy configuration should at least be very well thought

a set of my own patches around for having Dillo work the way I do, I won't
spend much time pressuring you into accepting them.

how ironic! i had dillo open on ebay for the very first time
last nite. i had wondered why i had not tried that before, now i know :-)
i did notice that the mime type was *very* stupid - what where those folks
at ebay thinking? - or am *i* being stupid and misunderstanding something?

i was just thinking that i should step thru the code in ups and see what
is going on...

the patch is an intriguing solution. it concerns me a trifle to start
hacking in octet-stream parsing into the mailine dillo code (welcome to
mozilla) - and i understand that the submitter understands that too,
that's why he referred to it as a hack.

perhaps an octet-stream parser plugin might be the best idea - that would
allow for isolation of broken pseudo-html into one clean location. That
cpould execute the magic number code and then ask the user if it was from
ebay and then offer to memorize that fact and do it automatically in the
future. Or it could be linked to a bookmark at that site to avoid question
asking - but that seems kinda hackish too.

2 related points:

1. octet-stream parsing is a general issue that needs a plugin - if the
mimetype is octet-stream but it's actually an MS-Word doc, then that would
be detectable (and handleable by invoking Abiword!) with this idea.

2. the 'ebay problem' maybe related to some commercial web-site creation
program that i am unaware of. if this where the case, then that would
imply that we would be likely to hit it again on some other site. Has
anybody ran into a similar example?

Hi list!


Here's a grouping of several issues mainly raised by Lars:

> History menus on back/forward buttons.

Done.


> Bookmark URL in status bar.

I'd like to shift bookmarks menu into a popup-menu because the
scrolling hack is only working with them (I don't know whether
it's possible to make it work with normal menus).

Note: the "scrolling hack" allows scrolling within popups that
are to long for the screen.

After careful consideration, I decided to try out a function
(Html_set_new_link) that avoids the main source of the second
a_Url_dup.
It seems to reduce render time by 25% on the most favorable
case (a page FULL of links) and to be near a 7% on the average ;)

Interesting question!

If the HTML specs don't specify that situation, then it is
broken HTML (as far as dillo is concerned). OTOH I see the point
in preserving the aspect ratio, but considering that those
attributes are deprecated, that the spec say they "overrride" the
original value, and that they seem to be expected as a couple,
maybe the best solution is to keep the "statu quo" and to raise a
warning message!

[Dillo-dev]Good Job Guys

From: Tony P <digital712@ho...> - 2001-10-08 17:14

I just joined to say what a spiffy little browser you guys have
created. Good work, looks really nice with AA font's too. Looking
forward to using it more often once the table rendering gets a little
better.

Oh ya, I was thinking the other day, Gnome Transfer Manager is a pretty
spiffy download program, since you guys are are going to make it a
plugin type browser anyway, this might be a fairly simple solution for
handling downloads. Just a thought.

Keep up the great work!

Thanks,

[Dillo-dev]Latest commit

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2001-10-06 14:22

Hi everyone!


Uhhh, I had been very short of time lately, mainly due to
splitting my attention between W3C's RAND concerns and dillo...

Anyway, I just commited a patch for navigation stack history,
it works as follows:

- Right click over Back or Forward button to activate
- Left-click to jump to selected URL
- Middle-click to open it in a new window
- Look at the status bar to check the URL you're selecting
- If there're too many items, the popup will scroll!


Actually there's still another 50% of the patch pending, but I
rushed it in because it has become a recurrent issue, and a need.

Fine print: I'm not sure of GTK+'s behaviour when closing or
activating popup items. It seems plausible for it to be
destroying them when not attached to any particular widget, but
as I said before, I'm not sure yet. Any light on this subject is
very welcome!

Please someone send me a diff to the help file that integrates
the above information.

Ah, I also set Ctrl-Q to close window and Alt-Q to quit, plus
some minor tweaks.


Enjoy
Jorge.-

I noticed "dillorc" last night and went nuts. :) I added a "tiny" icon
set, as well as a "miniscule" panel size. (Removes progress bar at the
top (they were cut off anyway) and status bar at the bottom (to save
verticle space))

True, but the problem is, the Agenda's already got FLTK in it, so
GTK+ would just eat up the userspace on the flash disk. :^/

It would also end up being a new requirement for people who want to
try it... unless I can get GTK to statically link for the Agenda.


Thanks!

I've been using dillo as my main browser on the ipaq, and providing a tweaked

main dillo, so people with yet another pda wouldn't need to start doing their 
own changes, just worry about porting. My version is at

This should be configurable so you could choose which toolbar buttons you 
want. The small icons are small enough for the ipaq, but there could be a set 
of micro icons, 5x5 pixels or something, to choose from.

Zooming would be great, but what I'd really like, and I think would be easier 
to implement too, is the ability to choose from a menu while running 
different rendering options such as hide images (remove space used by them 
too, maybe show links to them) and disable table rendering. You could then 
easily read the text which is usually the most important content of a page.

There's the Squashed GTK project for making gtk widgets smaller
http://mvista.so....net/projects/gtksquashed/ you might find useful. I 
think GTK is good enough for handhelds too.

Yes, as a pda it's better, but compared to desktop computers the resolution, 
ram and flash sizes are laughably small. The same aspects as you've described 
generally apply.

Yes, nested widgets make some things more complicated, but otherwise
tables much simpler. If the problem is to handle several nested
widgets, this is a idea: a simplification may be to serialize them
"virtually": to add some mechanisms to handle all text as it were in
one structure, by defining a data type to access text at one level,
e.g. as a pair of DwPage and line (or word) index. BTW, in a change
I'm currently working on (bug #201), I'm adding a possibility to find
the position of a widget within the parent widget fast, in a way
specific to the parent widget; for a page widget, it is the line
number (other widgets don't use this).

As I said, just a vague idea, without any implementation ideas.

It was Jorge, but finding text is probably simpler than text
selection.

[Dillo-dev]Dillo on Agenda VR3

From: William Kendrick <nbs@so...> - 2001-10-05 04:39

Hi! My name's Bill Kendrick. I'm poking around the web lately, trying to
see what kind of existing web browser software might be good to port to
the Agenda VR3 PDA. (It's a Linux-based handheld.)

Of the many I found listed on SourceForge, I found three which looked
promising. One of which didn't crash the minute I asked it to load a
web page. :) It was Dillo! :)

I was wondering if people have had luck running it on small devices,
and whether the existing codebase would lend itself well to converting
to other widget sets, other than GTK+. (The Agenda VR3 comes with FLTK
built-in. There's an FLTK-based browser around, called ViewML, but it
hasn't been updated since early this year.)

For those interested, the VR3 is a 66MHz MIPS-based system running
a Linux 2.4.x kernel. It has a 160x240 resolution LCD screen, which can
display 16 shades of grey (4bpp). It, of course, has a stylus. It also
has a soft keyboard/handwriting area which can be popped when needed.
The current versions have 8MB of RAM and 16MB of flash (about 3 or so are
currently available for user data and user-installed programs).


Late last night, half asleep, I whipped up a picture of what I think
a suitable web browser would look like on the Agenda, and it includes a
few options which wouldn't make too much sense on a desktop browser,
but hey... that's what "#ifdef"s are for. :)

You can see a mockup screenshot I made, as well as some details, here:

http://www.sonic.net/~nbs/agenda-browser/


The important aspects include:

1. Small form factor. Hide a lot of the less-used options inside
a menu. Make other widgets (forward, back, stop, scrollbars) as small
as possible.

2. Zoom-out. Agenda has 160 width. Many websites require (sigh) at least
800x600 display to be viewable. (sigh) Zooming out 5 times would
let you see the whole page without scrolling horizontally.

3. Zoom-in. ... Of course, at 1/5th the size, pages would be unreadable.
So I had the idea of a 'magnifying glass' mode. While zoomed out,
you can switch to what I call "PenZoom" mode, and pan around the page
and read it legibly.


Since GTK+ doesn't come with the default Agenda 'romdisk' releases, I think
the first step for someone porting it (oh no, am I volunteering? crap!)
would be to alter the code so that it can target to _either_ GTK+ (for
desktop users) or FLTK (for PDA users).

After that, adding the zoom features would be the next step.


What do people think? Am I crazy? Should I just try and start writing
an FLTK browser from scratch instead? Are any of you even interested in
PDAs yet? :) *


-bill!
bill@ne...
http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/bill/

* I did see one post from someone saying they use Dillo on an iPAQ.
It's in a completely different league than the Agenda. Color, faster,
higher resolution, more RAM and 'disk'space. But the fact that it
works is encouraging to me ;)

I agree that ripping off the menubars unclutters the browsing window, but it 
generates a new problem. For every menubar that gets ripped off there is a 
new window created. Which of course does clutter the window list.

Clearly, making the dirt go away and sweeping it under the carpet isn't the 
same thing. I want a nice and neat user interface.

The window managers job is to make it easy to switch focus between different 
active applications. It's not its job to hide things that shouldn't been 
there in the first place.

I've thought about rip off items before and came to the conclusion that best 
thing to do is to make it an option in gtk to hide the item instead of making
it a separate window.

Since I don't think I could implement such a change in the lib I made the 
change in the application instead.

Making the change in gtk would be the correct way to solve this for all 
applications. But I'm not man enough to make it. Anyone else feeling up to it?

From: <torkel@ly...> - 2001-10-04 20:42

Well, since the toolbars can be ripped off (as on all proper gtk
applications), and i can have the window manager hide them somewhere until
i need them, i would never use this feature.

Especially since i use dillo on my ipaq, where shortcut keys isn't an
option...

How about having that option control if dillo should start with toolbars
ripped off or not?

From: John Utz <john@ut...> - 2001-10-04 16:37

hi;

if somebody isnt working on this already. i'd be happy to.

i am using dillo to browse docs on my laptop on the bus to and from work,
and using the mouse is really not good in that situation :-).

tell me the procedure for owning this work. i feel that it should work the
same way lynx does modulo expected GTK widget behavior.

does anybody disagree with this?

should i create a feature bug in the bug tracker?

can somebody tell me anything beyond the naming conventions doc about
where this should go in the src code tree? it seems like control.c would
not be a *bad* place, but that seems not really right.

should this be a new module/file?

Attachments: dillo-nouglybar.patch      

Since I got no feedback what so ever on my last mail I'm retrying.

Tried dillo for the first time a couple of weeks ago and totally fell in love. 
It's a wonderful browser for the pages it does render. And I hope it will do
frames and cookies without getting bloated sometime in the future.

However there are a few things that irritates me in the user interface.

For example the panel at the top of the screen. I noticed that it's size could 
get changed. So I wrote these few lines to make it disappear all together.

Is there any chance that my patch could get applied in the official 
distribution? Should I change it in some way? Apply through the bts?

I believe there are more people than me who finds that the bar does nothing but 
wasting valuable screen space.

[Dillo-dev]Some profiling

From: Lars Clausen <lrclause@cs...> - 2001-10-03 16:33

I have my Dillo run with -pg, and when I restarted this morning to get the
newest patch in, I took out the gprof results. Here's the top ten of what
I got, this is from fairly standard browsing of slashdot, theregister, gtk
api docs, java docs, webboards, cnn and a few other things. There doesn't
seem to be anything critically slow, though a_Url_dup is called quite a
lot. The cache search is somewhat slow, maybe a g_hashtable will be useful
someday. All in all, I don't see anything that warrants change right
away. Good job!

I answered this early in the morning, and was about to quote
that anyone can make a backup of the main DB file with:

http://dillo.so....net/cgi-bin/bugtrack/Dillo_text.py

but it didn't work, so I decided to check it later.

Several hours after, I tested again (with a view to start
fixing), and it worked, just as before!

So, it _IS_ sourceforge having problems with CGI apps. In our
case, if the updating CGI was stopped shortly after it started,
that could explain the 1-sized files...

Too bad. I really like that feature. I dislike having to find the little
X button and then the url bar, when I'm used to just clicking anywhere on
the page. I guess I'll just make that a private patch.

This I have noticed. For our project the crucial part is the dw_page
(lines, words, ...) and it can be handled fairly easily. We have avoided
journeys to any other part of the dillo ... only a few minor interventions
in scrolled_frame/window (scrolling had generated motion notify event and
we wanted to distinct this event and the true pointer motion event).

I agree. We are doing this. The first working version is based on dillo
0.5.1, just now we are introducing specialized parts into the dillo 0.6.1
code. We would call this specialized version with a combination of names
"dillo" and "homer".

> Beware of the GPL: Your code MUST be GPLed!

Our project requires from us to do that.

Hmmm... I have already played with the tooltips. I will check the GTK+
mailing list.

Thanx again!

I know, I want it too. I even volunteered and begun to implement it. The hard
part is to highlight the selection, because there's nothing in dillo to do that.
Especially now, with tablesall over the place.
I believe the guys that implemented the find-text ran into the same problem ;-)

Quick poll about that: would you guys of the list be happy with a drag-box

I hate that too. Its easy enough to paste in the url bar.

A feature I'm dying to see though is selection support, it sucks to have

Interesting project!

Beware, though, that dillo is a visual user agent that's highly
optimized to be fast: with very innovative coding on the network
layers and cache for speed, fast and streamed table rendering for
early feedback, etc.

That means that the learning curve to modify the specialized
parts is quite steep and lofty. On the other hand, I see that the
simplicity of the parser and small codebase is a plus for your
project.

In brief, if you're planning for the mid to long term, I'd
suggest you to try to keep with one of the official releases and
to make a specialized version of dillo for the visually impaired
(instead of trying to catch-up with a patch scheme).

Dillo toolbars, and dw widgets are easy to hook: just as the
tooltips and as the hand-mouse-cursor.

Menus are different, because they're pure GTK widgets, you may
need to derive a custom class to do that, I'm not sure. Maybe the
tooltips code can hint you, and the authoritative source is the
GTK+ mailing list.

[Dillo-dev]Patch: Bug #211

From: Lars Clausen <lrclause@cs...> - 2001-10-01 20:51

Attached is a patch for bug #211: Save-as dialog does not remember dir.

It remembers the same dir for save page, save link and open file. It will
also remember the file name of the last saved or opened file and use that
for suggestions if the URL doesn't give a useable suggestion.

Re: [Dillo-dev]next encodings patch

Grigory,
[and everyone]

> Hello.

Hi!

> I'm new in this list so don't kick me strongly.

Hmmmm, what a shame we have come to expect that...

Fortunately this mailing list has a long tradition of polite,
technically skilled and cooperative email interchange, and we
love it that way!

Back in the old days when I was at the university, a memorable
teacher told us that the toughest problem of gathering a working
team of highly skilled to brilliant considered individuals was
that those guy's egos were bigger than a whole cathedral, and
that they would avoid cooperating with each other in the pursue
of demonstrating that they were the best overall, and that they
could undertake the whole task without the aid of anyone!

He was right...

I had come to observe that really brilliant or knowledgeable
people (up to geniuses), don't behave that way. They know what
they're worth, an thus doesn't have to demonstrate anything.

Even more, the later ones are the most cooperative, encouraging
and open to share their valuable knowledge, when it comes to help
their colleagues to improve their skills.

The excellent news is that being a genius is not a requirement
for adopting that working spirit; and so we did!

As described in the project notes (an as stated within all the
suggested reading-material), this problem is far from easy to
solve. BTW, the required framework will be available with
GTK+2.0. In the mean time, I'll provide links to custom patches
for specific languages, as long as they provide a home page that
explains how to apply and enable the patch, as well as what they
provide and what they break :).

So take your time, and when you have a stable version of your
code, just let me know, and I'll gladly add a link to it from the
i18n section of the [Links] page.


Regards
Jorge.-

Grumble. I can see some use for that, but it's limited to how far you can
move the mouse before hitting the edge of the screen. I really like having
middle mouse 'paste' the url in, that way url's found in text (inside our
outside the browser) can be opened really quickly. We could consider a
click with no movement to do paste, but that's rather fragile (what if your
middle button is flaky? what if you scroll a little trying to paste?).
Seems early to start making the mouse buttons configurable:)

The middle button (button 2) is already mapped to a scrolling function.

[Dillo-dev]Image scaling aspect ratio?

From: Lars Clausen <lrclause@cs...> - 2001-10-01 17:51

I had a page where an image was scaled by just setting the width. Most
browsers preserve the aspect ratio when scaling it, but not Dillo. The
HTML specs don't mention aspect ratio at all. Should we categorize this
under 'broken HTML', or should we keep the aspect ratio when only one of
width and height is specified?

Sounds great! One thing i'd like is to ahve the progress thing down on the
status bar, stretched out long instead of in a block, and to take the
address bar off of the menubar! Then dillos interface would fit my taste
much better.

Maybe i'll looki into doing one of those myself...

[Dillo-dev]Pending projects: History, scroll size, middle-click, space/back

From: Lars Clausen <lrclause@cs...> - 2001-10-01 17:09

The bugtrack system seems to be broken ATM. I'm starting to look at a
bunch of minor useability features that I miss in Dillo from other
browsers:

History menus on back/forward buttons (a la Galeon): Need to brush up on
events and menu creation.

Page scroll size is 1/2 page, I prefer a full page. This setting goes into
preferences. I tried setting adjustments in
Dw_gtk_scrolled_frame_set_scroll_adjustments, but it doesn't seem to be
called. Where should I go to reliably set [hv]adjustment->page_increment?=
=20

Middle mouse click on the page should open whatever is in the clipboard.
Anybody got a problem with that?

Space should scroll down, and probably Backspace scroll up. Some browsers
have Backspace go to previous page, but I don't like that. Any comments?
