[Dillo-dev]Faces

From: Chris Hawks <chrish@sy...> - 2002-04-30 22:43

Just a question for a new (and very impressed) user...


Why is the font face code commented out in html.c (about line 1720). I
un-commented it and it seems to work correctly...

Are you using version 0.2.4??? There was once a problem with other
charsets than iso8859-1, but AFAIK, this has been solved halfway some
time ago. (Sorry, I'm always using iso8859-1, so I don't have any
experiences.) Try to use a more recent version of dillo.

[Dillo-dev]CSS

From: Sebastian Geerken <sgeerken@st...> - 2002-04-30 17:06

Hi!

Below are some notes on how CSS may be implemented in dillo. It mainly
focusses on how the different parts "play together", many details for
the single modules are left out, there should be enough room for
different implementations. There are also some simplifications,
e.g. the user-agent defined style sheet may be implemented in a
different way. I've left out XML/CSS parsing, which should be possible
by this design, but makes many changes of the HTML parser necessary.

Please post comments, bugs, anticipated problems, ambiguities etc.

Sebastian

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------
A Possible Implementation of CSS in Dillo
-------------------------------------------

The User's View
===============

An important goal is asynchronous HTML/CSS parsing: when the HTML
parser reads a <LINK> tag referring to an external style sheet, it
continues to render the document _without_ the style sheet, while the
style sheet (if it is not already in the cache) is retrieved and
parsed parallel to this, and then applied on the current rendered part
of the document. If the time difference is large enough, the user will
notice a sudden change of colors, fonts, etc., but will be able to
read the content with less delay time (which may be several seconds).


Overview
========

The following diagram shows the associations between the data
structures, and there multiplicities. Worth to notice is that for
every document (represented currently by DilloHtmlLB), there is one
document tree (Document) and one CSS cascade. The details are
described below.

+-----------+
| DilloHTML |
+-----------+
0..1 | | 1
,-------' `------.
| |
1 V V *
+-------------+ +----------------+ 0..1 +---------+
| DilloHtmlLB | | DilloHtmlState |------>| Element |
+-------------+ +----------------+ 1 +---------+
1 | | 1 |
| | |
| | 1 +----------+
| `------------------------------->| Document |
| +----------+
| ^ 1
| +-------------+ |
`----------------->| CSS cascade |------'
1 +-------------+ 1



The Role of DwStyle
===================

The DwStyle structure will represent style attributes in one of the
following ways (for the exact terminology, see [CSS2] chapter 6.1):

1. Absolute values are represented directly. Examples are absolute
lengths. The value "auto" is handled the same way.

2. Some relative values are immediately computed, this may depend
on attributes of the parent element. Examples are relative line
heights, i.e. "line-height: 150%" will be computed into an
absolute (pixel) value.

3. Other relative sizes are represented this way in DwStyle,
examples are relative widths and heights.

Whether 2 or 3 applies to a specific attribute is determined by two
factors:

1. If the attribute value is independent of certain values, which
changes affect only the level of Dw (important: window size),
they can, for simplicity, put into category 2. Otherwise, they
must belong to 3. The latter may not be inherited, for the
reason, see next point.

2. Since only *computed* values may be inherited, attributes,
which values are inherited, may not be part of category 2,
since Dw will not be able to handle them correctly.


The Document Tree
=================

The document tree has two purposes:

1. representation of the document structure, needed for the
evaluation of CSS selectors, and
2. near-complete encapsulation of the dillo widget.

The HTML parser accesses for most elements only the document tree, and
not anymore Dw. The interface is similar to a small subset of the
Document Object Model (see [DOM2]), and provides methods for the
following purposes:

1. construction of nodes (mainly elements and text), adding them to
other nodes,
2. examining the structure (e.g. for evaluating CSS selectors),
3. assigning style attributes,
4. drawing, and
5. changing the state.

Some notes about the latter three points: The document tree is in most
cases able to construct and access the Dw structures simply by style
attributes. E.g., if the attribute "display" has the value "table", it
"knows" that it must create a DwTable and add it to the DwPage
associated with the parent node. This way, the HTML parser may be
simplified, much functionality can be replaced by a user-agent-defined
style sheet, as in [CSS2] appendix A.

Since this is not in all cases possible, two back-doors are kept open:

1. It is possible to add a special type of element to the tree,
with a specified DwWidget. The <img> tag will processed this
way.

2. DwStyle will be extended by non-standard attributes, when
necessary. For better distinction, they will be preceded by
"x_". Examples are "x_link" and "x_colspan".

An element may have a state, which is used as pseudo-element in the
style evaluation (see below). This is how the dynamic pseudo-classes
([CSS2] chapter 5.11.3) are handled. Changing this is e.g. done when
the user clicks on a not yet visited link, the state then switches
from "link" to "visited".


The CSS Cascade
===============

"CSS cascade" is a module, which is responsible for evaluating CSS
selectors ([CSS2] chapter 5). The evaluation function gets the element
node, the default attributes (DwStyle), and a "pseudo-element" as
argument, and returns a DwStyle with the values described in the
section "DwStyle". The caller is responsible to determine the default
attributes (those which are not changed, if no rule is found), either
by setting them to default values, or copying them from the parent
element.

About the "pseudo-element": An evaluation with this argument set to
non-NULL must only evaluate the rules containing this
"pseudo-element".

Of course, there is the need of a CSS parser. A "cascade" may combine
several style documents, from different origins (see [CSS2] chapter
6.4), so that the parser always adds rules to a cascade. There is no
need for an incremental parser, instead, a document is always parsed
as a whole (see below).

In some cases, it is necessary to add element-specific rules to the
cascade, either for evaluating the "style" attribute, or to process
(mostly deprecated) HTML elements and attributes.


Pseudo Elements and Generated Content
=====================================

Content is generated in two cases:

1. if the ":before" and ":after" pseudo elements are used ([CSS2]
chapter 5.12.3), and
2. for list items.

Content generation is the task of the document tree. For dealing with
":before" and ":after", one document element refers to three DwStyle:

(i) two from the evaluation of ":before" and ":after", and
(ii) one actual style.

The actual style may be affected by the state of the element.

(There are many things missing for pseudo elements, they have to be
specified, and some may not be implemented in dillo).


What Actually Happens in Different Situations
=============================================

Adding Elements to the Tree
---------------------------
This happens after the parser has read an opening tag:

1. The HTML parser evaluates the element attributes to create one
or two new, element-specific rules, and inserts them into the
CSS cascade.

2. The HTML parser adds a new element to the current document
element.

3. The CSS cascade determines the style, based on the style of the
parent, where some attributes are set to default values.

4. This style is attached to the new element, and the element is
drawn (e.g. the appropiate DwWidget methods are called).

Handling the <STYLE> Element
----------------------------
The content of <STYLE> is written into the stash. When </STYLE> is
written, following is done:

1. The HTML parser passes the stash content to the CSS parser,
which inserts the new rules into the CSS cascade.

2. The styles for the whole document are recalculated, and the
document is redrawn.

Handling the <LINK> Element
---------------------------
An external style sheet is read by a special cache client, which
writes the content into the buffer, and is associated with the
document tree and the CSS cascade. If the data has been fully
retrieved, the process is similar to <STYLE>, described above.

What is important is to preserve the order the documents have been
specified in the document, e.g. for

<link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
/* style sheet 2 */
</style>

it is likely that the content of <style> will be processed earlier,
although it has been specified later in the HTML document. This may be
done by assigning numbers to the style sheet documents, which are
increased each time <link> or <style> is processed.

[Dillo-dev]parsing of "file:" URLS

From: Arvind Narayanan <arvindn@my...> - 2002-04-30 17:06

Hi,

Typing file://foo/bar/ into the location bar takes you to /bar .
The function doing this (Url_object_new in url.c) says it's according
to rfc 2396. But the behavior is confusing, taken in conjunction
with the fact that file://foo takes you to the home directory (or
is it the current directory?). All this doesn't happen when there's
1 or 3 slashes after "file:" (the token following // is parsed
as "authority" and the path starts with the word after that).

Here's a browser-wise description

Dillo
file: , file:// , file://foo ==> current dir
file://foo/ ==> /
file://foo/bar ==> /bar

Moz
file: , file:// , file://foo ==> /
file://foo/bar ==> /bar

Konq
file: ==> home dir
file:// ==> /
file://foo ==> /foo

NS 4.7
file:// ==> /
file: , file://foo , file://foo/bar ==> "can't find host"

Opera
file: ==> /
file:// ==> "can't open"
file://foo ==> /foo

Nautilus
file: , file:// ==> "error"
file://foo ==> /foo

No two are identical :-)
(Can't get galeon to compile on my machine)

Of the lot I think Konq is the most intuitive from the average Joe's
POV. At least file://foo/bar ==> /bar should be avoided. Any thoughts?

Could and couldn't!

The current draft really needs more abstract work, specially on
design and particularly in design validation...

After that phase, the first prototype may be different (not
forked for intance, but more on this in the next post).

And yes, it may end having what you listed.

I only have an ancient prototype we worked with Holger. Most
probably the new dpi1 design will require something different,
and as I wrote above, and as you suggest, it certainly needs more
work.

It's a matter of deeply understanding the draft, considering
dillo internals and other implementation possibilities, then
probing the design (validating what's OK and fixing/modifying
what's wrong), then making a few pre-prototypes to test the
implemetation choices, and finally building a prototype.

It's and old companion of mine that I coded a long-long time
ago; I've shown it to a few fellows, that use it regularly and
that say to really miss when working without!

As dillo, it's very simple, small, fast and stays out of the
way. I never dared to make it public, because although very
stable, I never had the time to clean its code! (and there're
hundred of other editors out there).

You seem to have misunderstood the draft...

The client ID is generated by the cache (inside dillo), so the
client ID serves as what you call "request ID"!

Later on, the same client ID is sent back by the PI (in the
respective datagrams), so it serves as a kind of request-key.

Yes, this is an issue. I'll quote here what I answered to Geoff

Good point.

But it's not of current dillo internals, but of of a choice of
which communication channel we'll use to communicate (and launch)
the plugin.

I mean, maybe the PI can be started with a fork, or from a
pthread, or from another fancy mechanism (as an ad-hoc launcher
for instance; a helper program that forks itself and launches the
PI, and acts as intermediary between PIs and dillo). Those
are possibilities.

And as for how they will communicate, it could be stdin/stdout
(with fork for instance), in which case I can't see clearly how
resident PIs could be implemented :) (as its stdin/stdout would
be already in use).

But, on a fine grained basis, it can be argued that such a
resident PI could work if it were to remain resident but not
accept any new connection until finished with the one in
course...

...but the point is that if they were to communicate trough a
socket, or named pipe, or who knows, it could be possible to
handle them in the more general case.


Those are pending design issues...
>>


And that's the main point. Dpi1 needs some heavy work on design
and validation. Some other techniques need to be evaluated (as
the above mentioned), and tested.


The good news are:

<see next post> :)

Hello folks!

I've found a "new" (25-Apr-2002) article which mentions Dillo, at
http://www.linuxdevices.com, written by Patrick Glennon:

http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT2869412121.html

It's about building a kiosk with embedded Linux, and they seem to
use Dillo as their main GUI. Looks pretty cool, huh?

(BTW: I'm still making efforts to make the cache_size_limit patch work
100%. Pekka and I have both made different patches, but both are
wrong, and the few small issues that are left are really hard to get
around. I think that I'll probably have the patch ready for the next
release).

I'm resending my earlier posts about Dillo in articles for those who
have missed any. And I am considering opening a new page at our home
with links to these... something like "Press". Is such a page
interesting at all?

Has anyone seen any other articles which review/use/mention Dillo? I
would like to know to get the material ready.

best regards!

Ok, I gave some time to it, and as someone pointed out, there
were some missing <td> tags (but this wasn't the main problem).
It was fixed though.

As the funding page is generated by a script, and its results
are rendered perfectly by Netscape, Mozilla, Dillo, etc,
wrapping it within our main site-frame shouldn't be a problem
(it's done with another script, and there're plenty of working
pages already).

The point was: (ta ta ta taaaaaaaaaaannnn!.....)

That when adapting the script, the last </table> was commented
out!!!

So netscape thought there was a lot yet to come and as it needs
the whole table to start rendering, it did what you saw!

Ah, and as there were some lacking tags, you can imagine the
algorithmic hell in there.

---

Ahhhh, lots of times I've been thinking whether it would be a
good idea to construct some malformed pages with a view to
illustrate some people, that it is _very easy_ to pollute the web
in an effort to try to push one browser over another.

The ignorant thinks:

"Ah this browser is more powerful (or advanced) because it can
render this page."

or

"This browser is bad because I can't see this page, and it
renders Ok with *"


The right path though, is to try to keep it to the standards,
and not to pullute the informative space where we all benefit
form having access to.

My apologies for the mistake, it wasn't intended, we even tested
with several other browsers while developing it.


Please test the new HTML code, and report back how it went.

[Dillo-dev]Useful patches from the OpenBSD folks

From: Andreas Schweitzer <andy@ph...> - 2002-04-29 03:42

Hi everybody
While notifying the OpenBSD folks that they can upgrade
their dillo entry I noticed the patches they apply to
it before allowing a compile :
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/www/dillo/patches/
The 64bit issues certainly seem reasonable. As of this
writing the patches are against 0.6.4 and patches/patch-src_dns_c
and parts of patches/patch-src_IO_http_c are no longer necessary.
But the rest of the 64bit issues deserve consideration.

I also told them about our efforts to make it compile out of the
box on OpenBSD, therefore some other stuff will simplyfy as well.

The other BSD's have currently no relevant patches.

Cheers,
Andreas

In the objective to temporarily aliviate this issue, I've done a few
modifications to the referred page. Now the page renders "correctly"
in Dillo, w3m, lynx, Mozilla (0.9.9), and Konqueror (2.2). It is
totally ignored by Netscape (4.77).

I haven't tried any others (I have no Windows to try IE), but for
now I guess it's better than it was before.

Jorge, sorry for the sudden intrusion. You can revert my changes if
you like.

best regards to all!

[Dillo-dev]image rendering

following on from the funding thread..

I have reported a possible bug.

pages I maintain http://www.peepo.com/alfi/c.html

images 2 and 3 are not rendered by dillo but are by practically any

any ideas welcome.

there are numerous other jpegs, and links using the same scripts around

I looked at the code just now (even though I'm not Sebastian), and I
think the problem is that within a lot of <tr> tags there aren't <td>s.
Line 126 is one instance. This would explain why Netscape and
moz both have problems with it, netscape would just say "argh! problem!
ignore this bit!" and moz would say "argh! problem! render this somewhere 
else!" like with the geocities addbox.

http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://dillo.cipsga.org.br/funding/

shows a lot of other stuff too.

Hope this is useful,

I think the problem may relate to using tables within tables.
This is not to be encouraged, I've heard.

try http://validator.w3.org, there are numerous 'errors' most relate to 
the use of tables.
I had spotted this potential problem before validating.

i can also say that mozilla and ie6 fail to show the content which dillo 
does for the funding page.

Hmmm, strange thing.

I reviewed the code several times but havent't found anything
non-standard there. Netscape simply "eats" a big part of the
page, and tweaking the page by hand, I was able to isolate a case
where adding the simplest of the subtables in a row triggered the
problem (on Netscape). Mozilla, OTOH, renders the main part at
the bottom.

Well AFAIK, there's no problem with the HTML (that's generated
by a couple of scripts BTW). I may be wrong, or my knowledge of
the HTML table SPEC may not be perfect, so, the best that I can
do is to ask "our" tables expert: Sebastian.

Sebastian: Do you see anything wrong with the HTML of the
presentation, or is just a simultaneous fault on a couple of big
browsers? (certainly a rare case, although plausible).

Thanks for the reply, although I think you misunderstood. The
meta-refresh patch and cache size limit patch were not mine, they were
written by others, and they were good code patches, just created against
earlier versions of dillo then we were using. My attempts to merge them
in with 0.6.4 are what caused the problems, although they are working...

I'm hoping that the solutions they created will get merged, not my
hacked up attempts to mix them with 0.6.4... things are working now,
there are just some weird complaints undoubtedly due to my bad merge...

Hope that's more clear ;)

There is several things you can do.
- First, you can work against the cvs instead of a tarball. That way you can
keep you own version up to date (by doing 'cvs update -dP' regularly) and
still work on it.
- I understand there is two different features here. The best thing is
probably to use one cvs checkout for each of them, produce two patches when
you're happy, and apply the patches on your own "release" version.
- Make you patches available: post the url on the list. This way, people can
try them and fix them (while keeping you informed, of course). This will
speed-up *a*lot* the inclusion in the release, 'cause you can be sure Jorge
will never even look at a patch that's "pretty messy and complaining about

Re: [Dillo-dev]0.6.5 release

From: Ivo van Poorten <ivop@eu...> - 2002-04-27 00:37

Hello all,

I tried out dillo 0.6.5 today and I noticed that the page-up key didn't 
work (anymore?). I localized the problem. In dw_gtk_scrolled_frame.c at 
line 480 it says:

if (event->state & (GDK_MOD1_MASK | GDK_MOD2_MASK))
return FALSE;

I don't know what this is supposed to do (it's not in the pagedown 
section), but when I comment it out, pageup is working again.

Furthermore, I added two lines to menu.c at line 172:

Menu_add(menu, "Back", NULL, bw, a_Commands_back_callback, bw);
Menu_add(menu, "Forward", NULL, bw, a_Commands_forw_callback, bw);

It makes browsing more convenient this way, IMHO.
I have not thoroughly examined all the sourcecode and I have no serious 
plans to start coding on dillo, so maybe somebody could look into this and 
maybe make a patch to the CVS code. One question though, is there a reason 
why the icons in pixmap.h use so little colours?

I am currently keeping a pointer to the first and last selected child
widget, and descending the tree if the child widget has childs. (because the
de/selection calls happen more often than copy/paste, so de/linking is the
part to be optimized)

Depending on how you build the <div> elements in the page, you can
link/unlink a set of widgets to the link's container afterwards and that

Dillo depends on GdkRGB, which may not work with all displays. I've
attached a simple test, taken from the Gtk+ distribution. Please
compile (cc `gtk-config --cflags --libs` testrgb.c) and test it, and
report the results.

Since it sounds like using Pango is a slightly complicated task (since
apparently it is wrapped up into the GTK 2.0 conversion?), I was thinking
recently that perhaps a convenient temporary measure would be to just use
a library like iconv to convert whatever character set a webpage uses into
ISO-8859-1 (since "stock" Dillo currently supports only that character
set). That way, pages encoded in UTF-8 but using only characters
appearing in Latin1 could still be displayed correctly.

Any comments on this idea before I put any time into it? It's kind of a
hack, but the lack of support for unicode is pretty annoying, and in fact
prevents me from using Dillo to view my own web pages, so I might be
willing to put in some effort on this.

Read the web site:

Pango will be used, but no one has yet started with it, this is an

A solution would be to have abstract iterators, like in STL or
java.util.Iterator. Having static methods (with a state within the
widget) has the disadvantage of restricting the number of "running"
iterations at the same time to one.

BTW, do you need to represent the positions of the words (where the
selection starts and where it ends)? How do you plan to solve this
problem? This must be considered, too.

Yes, the DOM should hide Dw as far as possible, DwStyle will play an
important role.

Has to be thought of. This whole DOM thing will probably evolve over
the time.

Well, personally, I hate web based applications (read: their user
interface), or (even worse) classic applications trying to immitate
web pages. I'd rather see dillo to be able to integrate classical
(widget based) GUI's, to assist the user on document-centric
applications (e.g. a help browser, based on dillo and a plugin, which
shows a tree on the left side).

Just MHO, I don't want any replies on this :-)

Focus on construction, only because this is what is needed for
CSS. Full DOM (or something equivalent) could be an extension for the
future.

When displaying dillo on the 24bit display of my AIX box (which can handl=
e
8bit, 16bit and 24bit) it dies with

Gdk-ERROR **: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
serial 3120 error_code 8 request_code 130 minor_code 3

As soon as any image is displayed - text works fine.

I dug through archives and found this post :

http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-list/2000-June/msg00702.html

However, I could not use that info to fix the problem due
to my limited understanding of dillo's image handling :-)

Oh - and I inserted this into the bug-tracking engine.

Andreas

[Dillo-dev]0.6.5 release

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2002-04-26 14:16

Hi there,


Ok guys, the wait is over! dillo-0.6.5 is there ready for
download (finally we decided to revert to the old EAGAIN handler
in order to make the release, so don't hesitate).

I also made the freshmeat announcement (with dillo this time
--haaaaaa, what a pleasure! --just hope it works ;).

Ah, there's also some very interesting new material in the
site, so take your time and read it...

Clebration time!

Best regards

Humm, that's strange. I can't seem to reproduce the crash. I've
tried Dillo 0.6.4 and the lastest CVS. Both worked out ok.
Could you try to get a stack trace from the crash? Maybe we'll have a
better idea of why Dillo is crashing.

Oh, and instead of using 0.6.4, try reproducing the crash with 0.6.5
(which should be out some time today or tomorrow), or CVS (which will
be almost the same as 0.6.5, anyway).

best regards!

The tough point is when selected text goes accross containers (which happen
very often since almost every non-text, non-image dw is likely to be an
invisible containter containing another dw).
Here's what I think the set of features that would give a nice DOM-like
feeling:
- a struct that would be used as a return value for all the functions,
containing only a pointer to the widget (castable to dw_widget) and its type
(one of WORD, IMAGE, TABLE_CELL, and some others like line breaks, bullets
or list, form widgets, etc.)
- a get_next function (whatever you want to name it), that would accept as
parameters a pointer on the current widget, a mask for the type, and a
direction (next, next_sibling, previous, previous sibling, first_child).
- get_parent(pointer).

I am open to any suggestion for the implementation.
This could be done by having the functions walk the structure at run-time,
or add the relevant fields (type, next, previous, first child, parent) to
the dw struct at (page) build time (no need for get_* functions here, only
access the dw struct).

You might want to merge the concept of css "class" with the current
dw_style, then.

No matter how you do it, the ability to easily go to the next WORD will make

Nice idea. Can we find where in the html is located a word/widget from a
dw_page?

That would be an application using the dillo's BrowserWindows for rendering

This makes sens when you understand that most javascript "applications"
mainly try to mimic the behavior of more powerfull GUI toolkits (gtk/qt). Tk
almost had it right with Wish, but too much script-oriented.
I am affraid Dw insertion and deletion is mandatory for that long-term

I'm a bit hesitant with this subject. This is the story: I've
been working on presentation material for the site, and testing
its rendering with dillo; that is, small html files that are
re-created by a script very often, and then reloaded into dillo.
The sad new is that I've caught this problem twice:

[Dillo-dev]a way to have the toolbar disabled

From: CLOTILDE Guy Daniel <guy.clotilde@wa...> - 2002-04-24 10:15

Hi all
Maybe I lost my last post, so I post it once again.
Is there a way to disable the toolbars in dillo in dillorc?
If not is it in the list of things to be implemented?
For now, double-cliking in the page makes the toolbars appear/disappear .

Thanks for answers.

BTW, it seems quite quiet here since last weeks. 



Re: [Dillo-dev]Using Dillo on a 4bits per pixel device

From: Samyeer Metrani <sam@nc...> - 2002-04-23 03:39

Hello Livio,

Thank you for your email.

I tried out the patch but it does not solve my problem. I dont have a debugger on
the arm device that I am trying to run it on so I need to dig some more to find out
where the problem is coming from.

I will also try it out on a pc with a 16 color display and see what happens.

I know that bitmap(gif/jpeg) display is working fine because I have a program that
uses libjpeg and displays them fine. I have another browser (chimera) that is able
to display the gifs/jpeg's fine.

Is there anybody who has tried dillo on the mono compaq iPaq? I know that the color
compaq has a 12bit display I assume that the mono one would use a 4bit.

Warm Regards,

Samyeer

RE: [Dillo-dev]Dillo on Solaris 8..y

From: Yu-Fong Cho <yfcho@ms...> - 2002-04-22 14:19

Sadly, there is no Solaris x86 on the list, but only Solaris SPARC.

I was just wondering how much difference between Solaris x86 and Solaris
SPARC?
According to Sun, they are code compatible...
If a program is ok in Solaris SPARC, it should be no problem in Solaris x86
after recompiling it.

Please go to the [Links] page, Compatibility section. There's a
big list there. If it doesn't work for you on one of the listed
machines/OS it's probably a local configuration error.

SunOS 5.8 is Solaris 8.
Solaris 8 is the package name and SunOS 5.8 is the kernel name.

I guess you have to use GNU make, Sun make seems don't understand dillo

I don't know whether the problem is that people aren't responding. It

Yes, I believe someone has already complained about Dillo crashing
on low depth displays (or was it black&white too?) I don't remember
exactly.

I don't know exactly _what_ is making your Dillo crash. Maybe you
could try compiling it yourself and run under gdb... :

gdb ./dillo

(gdb) r
:
: Here Dillo will run and you can do your stuff to make it crash
:
CRASH!
(gdb) bt

Then you get a backtrace from Dillo's calls. You can either
interpret them yourself or post them here for help.

I've also made a patch so that Dillo uses a private colormap, maybe
it'll do something for you (I'm not promising anything ;-):

[Dillo-dev]Great Little Browser!!!!

From: Chris Hawks <chrish@sy...> - 2002-04-19 20:31

My company is looking for a browser to use as a UI for some of our
products, so, I've looked at several recently.

Until I found dillo, they were all big/slow/bloated/leaky of some
combination there-of.

Dillo is fast, clean, and robust. Really great!!

The first thing I missed was setting the font sizes thru HTML. I
uncommented the code in html.c to set the "face" and added code to set the
"size" and it works great!!!

I also added code to set the font and size for the gtk widgets. I can
send a diff if there is interest.


Thanks again!!!

Yes, find-text is ugly, and I'll try to find a cleaner, abstract
solution; please send me also what kind of interface you need (more or
less) exactly for text selection. I do not plan to make this too
complicated, just a simple way to access the text content of widgets
(see below).

There will be a subset of DOM for CSS, with a focus on simple
construction (appending nodes, no insertion), and especially changing
style attributes (asynchronous HTML/CSS processing). Especially for
the latter, an extended Dw interface is needed, but I haven't yet done
any work on this area.

If plugins will be able to access the document tree, they should IMO
do this by the DOM interface (except graphical plugins as described in
my post before).

I'm not sure if *this* DOM makes sense for text search and selection,
this could probably better handled by an extended Dw. DOM is more for
handling the *document* structure (as opposed to the widget
structure), which is crucial for CSS. (Of course, text selection could
copy HTML code into the cut buffer -- why not, at least as an option?)

Re: [Dillo-dev]Simple plugins

From: Sebastian Geerken <sgeerken@st...> - 2002-04-17 16:37

Hi!

Just some notes on graphical plugins. An idea I plan to test, is to
base this on GtkPlug and GtkSocket, which will be extended to support
the additional features in the size model of Dw. Extensions will be
implemented by using ICC (inter client communication) methods (like
window properties) instead of IPC. The only data which has to be
passed is the id of the socket window, this should be done via DPI1.

This is (aside from a new command) fully compatible with the current
DPI1 specification, so that the focus should now remain on
non-graphical aspects.

The way how dillo deals e.g. with <OBJECT>s, could be:

1. From the TYPE attribute (and the "imaginary" plugin registration
file), dillo knows what plugin to start (when necessary). If
this type is not supported, the alternative content is displayed.

2. The HTML parser creates a DwSocket (Dw's analogum to GtkSocket),
adds it to the current DwPage, and then sends the command
DpiCreateDwPlug, with a window id as data. Dillo does *not* have
to wait, until the plugin creates the plug window.

3. The plugin then receives and processes the data in a way already
specified.

Some points are missing:

1. For toplevel plugins, the "Content-Type" field of the HTTP
response (or perhaps only the "URL suffix") has to be evaluated.

2. In case of an error, after the DpiCreatePlugWindow has been
sent, dillo should somehow render the alternative content. This
is a pure rendering issue, Dw (or perhaps an other level above)
has to be extended for this.

The code for the plugin will be similar to plugins using the Gtk+
plug/socket mechanism, perhaps it will even be backward-compatible, so
that simple graphical plugins may be implemented by creating a
GtkPlug.

Aside from that, perhaps GtkPlug and GtkSocket could also used for
some more complex GUI extensions, for which dillo could reserve some
space for. I thought of something like the sidebar steps in Mozilla.

RE: [Dillo-dev]Simple plugins

From: Eric GAUDET <eric.gaudet@vn...> - 2002-04-12 07:04

Hi,

Tow things I=B4d like to see changed in the dpi1 proposal:

- D1 and D2 fields being 2 bytes long, the endianness can be an issue. I =
think
it will be better to have 1 byte fields D1, D2, D3, D4 instead.

- Along with the client ID, I think a request ID is needed too, to ensure
multiple windows calling the same PI concurently don=B4t get confused in =
their
connections.
There is several ways to do that, depending on if we want dillo or the PI=
to
generate those IDs. IMHO it would be easier for everyone if the PI took c=
are
of the communications its involved in.
What I propose is to add the dillo->dpi command DpiNewRequest generating =
a
unique request ID in an atomic fashion (by incrementing an index for a st=
ruct
table, for instance), and returning the request ID to the client. This me=
ans
that dillo must use this command every time it wants to do a DpiUri. We=B4=
ll also
need a DpiFreeRequest for dillo to tell the PI its closing the communicat=
ion,
so the PI can reuse the slot for futher requests.
For dpi-initiated communication, the dpi generates a request ID by itself=
, and
dillo must reuse the request ID to answer.=20

The way I see the implementation from a plugin standpoint, is to have a
MyParamStruct containing all variables needed for one single request.

int myParamMax =3D 4;
int myParamNumber =3D 0;

MyParamStruct *myParam;

and malloc it with an a_List_ like macro, then for each request find the =
first
available slot in *myParam and using the index as the request ID.
Every time a command is received or issued, all the data needed are in
myParam[requestID].

I=B4d also want to make sure multiple connection are not made simultaneou=
sly in
stdin/stdout. For that, dillo will need to have a pipe lock mecanism to b=
e set
every time a datagram is transmited, until the transmission of this parti=
cular
datagram is completed.

Best,
Eric

Hi Jorge,

I think we can agree that according to the dpi1 proposal, the initial pat=
ch
will include the following parts:
- init code
- plugin forking and pipe registration
- url indirection to plugin pipes and rendering.

There will also be a minimal reference implementation plugin, that will
probably be a script or a small C program.

I=B4d like to know what code you already have, what code you have needs r=
ework,
and if you plan to integrate any code soon or you prefer to discuss about=
it a
little bit.

Howdy, 

I'm testing Dillo for an embedded systems project, and am desperately
looking for patches against 0.6.4 or the cvs version for meta-refresh
support as well as for the 0 cache-size support.

We have seen some weirdness on the dillo-cache regarding posting form

random ids in the POST URL. If anyone knows a simple way to disable the
cache, that would be delightful as well!

No, my main box is a Sparc 5 with a 256 color adaptor, so I'm in a
similiar situation. However, as long as I start Dillo up early and use a
window manager that handles colors well (e.g., Icewm), I don't have any
problems with the colormap.

On Blackbox, if I started Dillo 6.3 after other programs, Dillo would
absolutely ruin images -- even the old Dillo title (on the old site's
main page) would be all brown and gray. Switching to Icewm, GTK-only
apps, and starting Dillo early in a session fixed all that.

I'll try out the patch when I get back home, but I'm not expecting a
huge change. I will point out that QT seems to deal with 8bpp displays
quite a bit better than GTK does -- poor colormap support is a known
defect. Not that I'd want Dillo to be QT-based -- speed is of the
essence. =)

Yes. Upgrade. :)

Seriously, I wish X had done a virtual full-colour screen and a conversion
in the server like Mac does. Would have way reduced these problems. Would
also have made multi-screen displays much easier. We will need to support
8bpp, though.

[Dillo-dev][PATCH] Private colormap

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@im...> - 2002-04-10 01:06

Hello,

recently I've been using Dillo on a system with only 8bpp. X runs
out of colors pretty quickly, and specially when Dillo is showing
images, the colormap gets pretty ugly.

To solve this we have to, basically, add this to the initialization
(in dillo.c):

+ gtk_widget_set_default_colormap (gdk_rgb_get_cmap());

With this, Dillo grabs a "private" colormap. This makes the X
colormap "flip" when focusing on-to/out-of Dillo. (Similar to
Netscape's `-install` option).

My patch not only adds this, but also adds a preference in dillorc
called `use_private_colormap`. The patch is at:

http://www.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/patches/private_colormap.diff

Does anyone need this? Any comments? (Am I the only one with measly
8 bit per pixel ? :(

From: Nikita V. Borodikhin <eliterr@tk...> - 2002-04-09 19:49

Hi, All !

There is one problem with saving a page:
if curent page is generated as result of POST then saving it
gives you the page (cahed or reloaded) with that url and no POST-data.

This patch makes dillo to save exactly the page currently shown:

http://melvin.hadasht.free.fr/dillo/
or 
http://freefluid.dyndns.org/dillo/ (not 24/24)

dillo-embed-cvs-27-03-2002.patch:

a gtkplug must be created by another application, then it runs 'dillo
-xid XXXX' where XXXX is the XID of the window created by gtkplug (more
info by request)

dillo-local-cvs-30-03-2002.patch:

start dillo with '-l' option, and all non 127.*.*.* http requests are
reported as 'can't solve ...'

The full window (not full screen) patch is not there, but I can put it
if requested.

I don't think both patches are compatibles. If you want, I'll put a
patch having all 3 features (xid, local browsing, and full window
startup)

Cheers

Re: [Dillo-dev]Mouse-Wheel not working anymore

From: Ralph Slooten <ralph@de...> - 2002-04-09 05:32

I just tried the CVS from yesterday, and it's working again :-) Since the
20020327 version I had tried for several days (almost each day) to get it
working with new CVS versions , but each day it didn't. Newer versions just
scrolled down, but as I said, not up.

But that seems to be fixed now. No idea how or what though :-) I didn't use 
your patch (thanks for the effort though).

Many thanks,

Greetings
Ralph

Hello Jonathan!

Well, this has been discussed here at the end of the last year (2001):
http://so....net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=878753

That was my first message about the subject, but at the bottom,
you'll see links to some more thoughts from others (specially Jorge,
the maintainer). My first post was rather "euforic" (with lots of
English mistakes ;), but if you read my second post and some of the
others, you'll see that we have reached a "consensus" about leaving
sourceforge.

> will the mailing list stay at sourceforge?

Probably not. The goal is to take everything away from
SourceForge. We are still trying to get the mailing lists up at
CIPSGA, CVS should follow.

But please, don't worry. The move should ease developers to keep
contributing to the project. Plus, _everything_ will be announced
ahead of time! We will (probably) leave notices at the out SF site,
redirecting the home page, CVS and mailing lists.

best regards to all!

Hum.. now that you mention it, I _do_ have a similar problem. Except
it happens not only with the mouse wheel, but with PageUp as well.

> Any ideas?

Yup... I think Jorge made some additions to the interface to allow
SPACE to PageDown and 'b' or 'B' to PageUp. But he also added a
additional check to see if those 'b's had an additional modifier (like
Alt-B, which should actually access the Bookmarks menu).

In my case GDK_MOD2_MASK is the Num Lock... so it kind of took a
while to understand why sometimes it worked, and why sometimes it
didn't... 

Ralph, does the mouse-wheel going up issue disappear with your
NumLock off? Is your keyboard a 101-US? (Does the following patch help
at all?)

I have a patch here... I does only two things:

[1] Doesn't check modifier upon normal PageUp button.

[2] When 'b' or 'B' are pressed only check for GDK_MOD1_MASK

Item 2 is "optional" (in the sense that item 1 should solve your
mouse problem, and my PageUp problem, but would still have a problem
with 'b' and NumLock on).

Getting the modifiers right is kind of tricky, because it depends on
the X keyboard mappings... check here for more info:

I made a patch to embed the X window of dillo using gtk_plug/gtk_socket.
Works like a charm. See dillo mail archive, subject '[Dillo-dev]patch:
embedding dillo'. That means, dillo is run as an external program, only
its window is embedded in an application. Although, I don't think this
is sufficient for you. (With other (available) patches to allow

[Dillo-dev]Abstraction to user interface

From: Erich Schubert <erich@de...> - 2002-04-07 22:07

I'd like to see dillo as html renderer for upcomding galeon2.
Galeon2 tries to become mozilla-independant, so it possibly could use
gtkhtml2 or dillo as alternative renderers...

Does dillo support this? Is there some dillo-embed wiget i could use in
own programs? I just looked at the source and it did not seem to me as
if this is possible right now :-(

mozilla is so slow and needs so much memory, but i just love the galeon
user interface...

[Dillo-dev]Speed: and the wheely mouse

From: jonathan chetwynd <j.chetwynd@bt...> - 2002-04-06 15:26

I'm just beginning to use dillo on my laptop, having been stunned by how 
fast it is on the ipaq.
I'm certain there is a need for a visual lynx, though the 'dillo' name 
is somewhat wanting...

How will animated gifs, css, javascript bookmarklets, impact on speed.
You may not have answers, but please don't sacrifice speed, its a niche 
you fit very well

Is it possible that a wheely mouse could be used to scroll thru the 
history file?

thanks

[Dillo-dev]question about html parser

From: Madis Janson <madis@cy...> - 2002-04-03 17:02

does nested tags use parent tag data structures? i mean, whether it is
safe to delete parent tag from tag stack and move its children down to its
place, when closing a tag. for example html like this:

<form>
...
<table>

</form>

...
</table>

currently dillo just kills the table, when it founds </form> tag.
i've thought about modifing parser to search matching tag and close only
the matching tag in Html_pop_tag function.

Then add my voice to the list of successful reports. I prefer the
new site as well. Design is nice and usable, bugtracking works fine
too - at least the few things I tested =)

Yet the compatibility page seems incomplete, if you don't mind 
occasional memory faults out of the gtk you may as well use dillo
on QNX RTP 6.1/x86 as well =)

I have to wonder, why the two data fields and then 'length' amount of data?
Why not have any data fields be a part of the data?

I'd like to see things like page info (date, size, server, cache-info etc)
being passed to plugins.

I'm not sure how actual data download works with this. How would, say, an
external viewer plugin get the data to feed to the external program (not
all external programs understand URI's)? Dillo already handles download,
so it seems we should take advantage of that. Perhaps the plugin can tell
Dillo to save the data to a file, or pass it into a socket, or something?

I like the idea of prefs being a plugin, but there's some work to be done
to make Dillo actually use new prefs internally. Not too hard, probably.

I've been thinking about a better version of the external viewer program,
and of course I'd like to do it with plugins, when they are available.
Here's my idea:

At startup, parse either ~/.mailcap or ~/.dillo/viewers to set up known
viewers. Also parse /etc/mailcap, but store the associations separately.

The default viewer for unknown mime types should be a handler that asks
the users what to do: Either save to disk, specify a program directly,
or pick one of the associated programs found in /etc/mailcap. Optionally
store this in either ~/.mailcap or ~/.dillo/viewers, if it is to be
permanent.=20

This makes for a nice intermediate between 'one fixed viewer' and 'select
any program', and fits well into the current mime system. As for

Could you put a link to the new site up on the old site, perhaps?

Hi Jorge,

I am so glad you finally gave the dpi some priority! I can=B4t help notic=
ing that
you came back to most of my initial design, even if you gave me a hard ti=
me
back then because you found it too complicated :-)

I still have to review it in detail, though. I=B4d also want to know how =
much
code you have have for it and for what feature, since a lot of people see=
m to
have sent you a contribution.

Now I had almost a year of reflection about it, I think that there is a m=
ajor
flaw to this dpi1-plus plugin: re-entrance will be very difficult to main=
tain
with the proposed design, basically leaving it up to the plugin=B4s devel=
oper.
That=B4s because most plugins will be kept alive. This half-baked dpi1-al=
most2
propostion does not satisfy me.

Since it seems to be a good time for discussing about it, here=B4s what I=
think.

1) revert to dpi1 with one simple request-answer scheme without keeping i=
t alive
(perhaps by using the implementation I did before), or simply abandon it.

2) push the current proposition up to a full dpi2, where each plugin will=
be
loaded and kept alive a staring time. A lot of simplification can be done=
here:
no more stdin-stdout, but use dlopen with a clean interface of calling
functions to implement; all relevant data for each request would be maint=
ained
by a session struct passed as a pointer to each of these functions.

If we choose to go to a full dpi2 right away, (which can take some time,
this is why I propose to keep the early dpi1 for now), we will need more
interaction with the rendering engine, which calls for the two following
features:

- the ability to walk the internal representation of the page: for now, i=
t=B4s a
pain in the ass to find which dw =A8children=A8 are actually rendered, wh=
ich are
words, which are containers, etc. The find_text code talks by itself, and=
I am
postponing the text copy-paste until I find a good solution.

- the ability to dynamically change the tree structure, not only be alter=
ing
the content of it, but by inserting and removing words and widgets. Right=
now,
the result when trying that is guaranteed to be =A8unknown=A8.

This means we have to come with some sort of DOM interface on top of the
internal dw representation. A lot of good could come from it, including t=
he
ability for dillo to become a generic-application client as well as a bet=
ter
browser, at almost no cost in development and no =A8bloat=A8.

Mozilla=B4s gecko rendering engine is successful amongst developers becau=
se it=B4s
mimic-ing the MSIE=B4s poor internal representation they know, let=B4s de=
sign
something better.

Best,
Eric

PS: Jorge, I wanted to ask you this for a long time: what text editor do =
you
use, with that =A8justify=A8 in plain text?

[Dillo-dev]Simple plugins

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2002-04-02 23:19

Hi there!

Those of you that read my "Dillo plans for 2002" post should
have a good overview of what's currently going on:

http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/702/2002/1/0/7681591/

As you may see there, my first priority now is getting some
funds to keep rolling dillo project; it's a tough situation, so
I'm currently making some presentation material to show to
potential contributors... (Please re-read the post for details).



I've noticed special interest for what we agred to call "simple
plugins". At least, Russell, Paul, Johnatan, Bruce, Ralph, Geoff,
Tomas, Imad, Mark, Stephen and Eric have wrote something directly
or closely related to them. Considering the situation, I decided
to give some time to it, and prepared a new draft of the dpi1
spec. The document is several pages long, so I put it under the
"Developers" section of the new site.

Please read it as it's the generic answer to all of those
posts that seemed forgoten, but that were not!

The doc is somewhat dense and will surely require some time to
study, digest and comprehend. Well, with that interest showing, I
think it's a good time to give it some thought.

This is the opportunity to discuss, design, improve, correct,
etc. (is far better to correct the design than trying to mend an
unsuitable piece of code.)

Best of luck with it!


Ah, passing to another subject, I have a couple of SSL
implementations to review here, but I'll get into them later
(maybe in a month or more). I'd love to have some more feedback
from the authors, just to know how they behave and why they
decided to implement it that way.

Finally, dillo-0.6.5 release is planned for mid April, from the
new site!!!


Stay tuned!
Jorge.-

Worked fine when I tested it. Like the layout too.

Thanks a lot Madis. A couple more successful reports and I'll
turn it our official site. It's much better!


Cheers
