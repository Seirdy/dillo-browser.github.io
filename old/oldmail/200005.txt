Thank you very much for the explanation. Although I haven't got
the time (yet) to analyze it in full detail, it is and will be of
great help.

When dealing with the new cache scheme (and formerly with the
dicache and the image resize), I faced similar problems. It seems
that a state machine is a good way to solve that nasty race
conditions, but I prefer a flag scheme, just because it is more
flexible and easier to implement. Maybe that'd become the final
fix of it...

I've been stress testing the patch, it works nearly 95% of the
time, not perfect, but definitively better than what we had.
It *earned* its way into the code!

Once again, thank you very much.

[Dillo-dev]Bug 35... fixed! (I hope)

From: <andrew@ma...> - 2000-05-25 23:02

Attachments: Message as HTML      

I think I finally nailed that nasty bug 35. From extensive g_prints, I
discovered what was going on:

1) Dillo makes a new browser, and a GtkDwView structure some time later.
This starts out with a visible region of (0,0) to (101,101) for its
container.
2) Shortly thereafter, dw_gtk_view_size_allocate is called to make the
viewport the correct size. However, the container's visible region only
gets updated if the widget is realized, which it is not (yet).
3) Meanwhile, the first paint requests have been called, and dillo begins
to start the drawing functions. All rectangles get clipped to the
"visible" region of (0,0)-(101,101).
4) Finally (a fraction of a second later), the window shows up and the
viewport is realized. But it's too late. The drawing is done on the old
visible rectangle.
5) Right _after_ this happens, dw_gtk_view_size_allocate is called again,
with a realized widget. The visible rectangle of the viewport's container
is properly adjusted, and things work from here on out.

Sorry, that wasn't very clear. I hope you can sort of follow what I'm
saying.

Anyway, the fix I came up with involves changing the code in
Dw_gtk_view_size_allocate so that dw_view->dw_container->visible is
updated regardless of whether the widget is realized or not. I don't think
this should create any problem as there is already a check in place to
make sure the widget isn't null. The diff is attached.

The only other way around this that I saw was to change the structure of
dillo so that the drawing functions only got called after the window was
visible, but this might have taken a total rewrite of many of the
functions.

Hope the change works out.

Well, progress but no fix. My time just sort of disappeared. (I joined the
project during a time of low activity in my other projects, which
subsequently picked up again. Figures.)

Anyway, I'll look back at it. I think it could be as simple as setting the
visible rectangle of the viewport to be the size of the window rather than
the default 101x101. I just haven't nailed down the best way to do that.

There will be a fix, but it might come after the initial release.

[Dillo-dev]Very close to a new release

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@hu...> - 2000-05-24 21:50

Hi!

The traffic here has been very low, but Dillo survived a major
architecture change; the new release will be a half-new browser!

In fact, all the IO engine and http stuff was rewritten from 
scratch, and even the way data is passed to rendering routines 
changed.
Mainly this means that the cache integrates with the IO engine
and that the rest of the browser deals with the cache part only
(it works as an abstraction layer).

Although the system remains very complex, it is much easier to
understand, extend and change.

THIS IS NOT VAPORWARE!!!
It is running NOW!

I'm just polishing raw edges to follow the "evolving" model we 
use, and accordingly, to release a better browser.
Primary tests had gone very well. (Except for a problem with 
redhat and its socket handling --Don't worry, its OK now).



Andrew: 

It would be very nice to integrate a fix for bug #35 in the new
release; Any progress with that?

I'll see what I can do. Maybe I'll post some sort of log here if I get
stuck again. Right now I'm just fighting lack of time.

I think the reason that sometimes it gets rendered and sometimes not has
to do with the rect that gets sent to the draw function-- it gets clipped
to the supposed "visible" region of the dillo widget, which, at least the
first time, isn't correct.

Good! 
That's the kind of work we need.

Well, not having documentation about Dillo widget is one of our
problems. I'd very much like to have that written; but priorities
had kept me away from that...

Sorry, but I can't tell you if that's THE right fix. Probably
what needs to be done is to find out how the update is triggered
(and carried out) after hitting the reload button. And noting why
sometimes a page renders and some others not; due to a race
condition on a gtk idle function? Bad init values?
... and after that, to decide if that's the right patch.

Anyway, if it fixes the problem, we can make it into our code
with a "todo: assert this is the right way to do this" tag on it
:)

Any new or progress notice is welcomed
Good luck!

I would like the preferences stuff to be worked out as a
plugin. I mean something like "dillo:/preferences". It would be
easier to maintain and that way we keep the core small.
As a matter of fact, the bookmarks can also be implemented that
way.

[Dillo-dev]Bug 35 progess

From: <andrew@ma...> - 2000-05-05 18:23

OK, I'm busy trying to track down the source of bug 35 (screen not drawing
properly the first time), and I've found some interesting things in the
process.

I turned on verbose messaging and added a lot of g_print's of my own so I
could get a feel for what's going on. First of all, on my Intel box
running GTK+ 1.2.3, I noticed that creating the window never calls
size_allocate, but it does show all the widgets, so the first time around,
the sizes are things like (0,0) to (10, 65533), negative numbers, and
other crazy stuff. This doesn't happen on GTK+ 1.2.6 on PowerPC. This is
undoubtedly a GTK flaw, not a Dillo one, and I think it's unrelated to the
problem.

On my Intel box, the page draws correctly except for the hr tags. I
haven't figured that out yet. On the Power Mac, it only draws a part of
the screen until I hit reload. I think the fundamental problem is in
dw_gtk_view.c in the a_Dw_gtk_view_new function. It sets the visible
rectangle as (0,0)-(101,101) with a "todo"comment to make it reflect the
widget size. (101,101) is coincidentally where the drawing gets cut off on
the Power Mac.

When I hit reload, it gets updated, and I haven't traced the code to
figure out where or how that happens.

I figure that the best fix is to make the visible rectangle update right
away (I don't know how I'll do that yet). Or is that just covering the
symptoms without fixing the problem?

Hi there!

I received mail from Mark, Andrew, and some time ago from James
in my ematic.com address. In fact I receive Ok from several other
places, and will assume it works right unless someone here tells
me it failed.

Thanks
