[Dillo-dev]Attribute parsing

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2001-08-30 21:07

Hi there!


There's a very interesting topic around attribute parsing in
HTML (as SGML). I want to tie three comments I have that stem
from the same root:

I) Sebastian wrote:

Most of you will remember the discussion on how to parse the HREF
attribute of the <a> tag. This is a similar problem: in

http://cvs.so....net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/dillo/

you'll find something like

<table width="100&#37;">

Dillo reads this as "100" (pixels) and complains about the garbage at
the end. I'm not an SGML expert, so I thought to post this to the
list. Have attributes to be be parsed generally, or is this page
invalid?

II) Bruno wrote (about BUG#190):

I went to http://validator.w3.org, and it lists 2 Html 4.01
specs, "Strict" and "Traditional"

I fed a page with newlines in an anchor-string into the
Validator, and it Validates OK for "Traditional". I admit it does
not for "Strict"

In fact i did this before i even started coding, because if i
knew it was "wrong" html i wouldn't have bothered.

Now, i went to
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/types.html

|| The document type definition specifies the syntax of HTML
|| element content and attribute values using SGML tokens (e.g.,
|| PCDATA, CDATA, NAME, ID, etc.).
|| See [ISO8879] for their full definitions. The following is
|| a summary of key information:
||
|| CDATA is a sequence of characters from the document character
|| set and may include character entities. User agents should
|| interpret attribute values as follows:
|| * Replace character entities with characters,
|| * Ignore line feeds,
|| * Replace each carriage return or tab with a single space

Notice the: "Ignore line feeds"

Although further down it says:
For some HTML 4 attributes with CDATA attribute values, the
specification imposes further constraints on the set of legal
values for the attribute that may not be expressed by the DTD.

III) Eric sent me an emergency-patch for BUG#197

That bug is NOT related with the cache but with an URL that's
more than 1024 bytes long.




As currently dillo has fixed limits for attribute values (a
violation to the standards), and as we are parsing entities only
in a few places, and as patching current code only adds more
passes over the same code, the clean solution is to reimplement
attribute parsing, eliminating the length constraint, and using
the same function for parsing entities and hexadecimal character
references, all in the same pass!

The meat of it starts with the Html_get_attr() function. I
thought that implementing it with a static GString, and returning
its 'str' contents as 'const gchar *' should do the trick. And
that way the allocation/deallocation overhead is avoided, and it
gets easier to make the whole parsing in a single pass.

Note that the calling function may g_strdup the returned
string when necessary.

That way, we could have something like:

const gchar *Html_get_attr(...)
{

}


This is the gross idea and further refinement is required, but
considering that the html parsing module is well isolated from
the rest of dillo, this task is of an intermediate complexity
degree, and fits perfect for some guys I'll not dare to mention!

Seriously, I'd certainly appreciate some of our developers to
work on this task; maybe the perfect team is a couple with a main
developer and a dillo-html-parsing versed consultant.



Thanks a lot
Jorge.-

I sent a email to Jorge last week asking him if he wanted a patch 
for it, but as he said here on this list ATM he has so much
email to work through so he hasn't reply'd to me yet.
I also made a patch for it, although it took me a bit
longer than a few minutes :)

(Need to use port 8080 since my ISP seems to filter 80)

I think your patch reads better. Can you take over and send it
to Jorge so that anoying bug gets fixed?

The changes seem to be performing very well! Ever since Dillo
started supporting tables, I've been using it as my main
browser. Seldomly I use Netscape for frame viewing... therefore I've
been testing Dillo a lot. Well, generally the pages I go to don't use
flash, javascript, etc, so I have no complaints.

Dillo is more stable than ever. I can browse, sometimes for hours
straight without getting a Seg Fault (right now, for example, it's
been running for 6 hours.. mainly doing google searches, and reading
Linux Kernel documentation).

[Dillo-dev]About bug #194

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2001-08-29 01:34

Hi all,

I was looking at slashdot this weekend, and saw that they used a
"diferent" URL scheme inside hrefs... they simply leave out the
scheme, i.e., something like: <a href="//dillo.s...net/">, which looked
totally bogus at first. But looking through the URI RFC (#2396), I
think it's ok to leave out the scheme, and hence the URL must be
interpreted as a relative URL. In this case, therefore, the scheme is
inheritated from the base URL.

In a couple of minutes, I've made an awful fix. With my patch,
a_Url_str_resolve_relative() correctly parses this kind of
scheme-absent URL. But I see on the bug-track that this is being
worked on. I just want to send this patch to bwidmann@ut...
(Bruno, right?), as a basis for his work if he is having any
trouble. Also, feel free to ask me anything about URL's in Dillo.

The patch is at:

Hi there!

I'm very happy to have finally finished the massive changes I
was working with; the diff file was 2000 lines long!

The main point of it was stability, completion and extension.
No new features. Comments from those of you testing this new
version are very welcomed.

Now is time to restart answering a pile of emails, to review
and integrate the patches I have in the queue, and to start
moving a couple of ideas that sprung out while working my last

[Dillo-dev]Problems with swedish (international?) characters as entities in forms buttons, lists

From: Hugo Hallqvist <hugha495@st...> - 2001-08-28 14:38

I got problems with swedish (international?) characters in buttons and in lists. The characters for example &auml; shows up properly in the usual text on a page, but no when they are to be added in the dropdownlist in a form or as a button in a submit form.
I experimented a little and dillo parses the entities correctly, the string puts out nicely in the xterm window, but gtk doesn't seem to like it when it is to add the component(button for example).
Maybe this has something to do with the gtk_set_locale thing?

http://www.blocket.se is good to test this on. It shows up pretty quickly in the dropdowns.
It is reported as bug #199.

[Dillo-dev]Currently working on:

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2001-08-21 21:43

Hi there!

------
Status
------

After some days of silence (and full work), I made some space
to let you know what I've been working in.

Considering that plugins, https, cookies and authentication
are very close to implement, and noting that they all depend on
the Cache/IO layer, I'm trying to fix, extend and finish several
things there.

Dillo-0.6.0 uses a lot of workarounds to achieve a certain
stability degree, but it leaves inconsistent states, doesn't
finish some tasks, and is incomplete.

When the above mentioned features are provided, people will
start trying to perform more serious tasks with dillo, ant it's
not ready for that yet, so I'm trying to stabilize those layers.

Currently I have a truck-load of changes to test and merge...


------------------------
Dillo records in the Web
------------------------

A fast survey for 'dillo browser' on google shows a lot of
places that "advertise" our project. Unfortunately those records
are not up to date, and the versions listed are ancient!

Is sad to read that dillo doesn't support tables, that current
version is 0.2.1 and thing like that.

From time to time I get emails from people willing to help,
that don't know how to code. THIS is a great chance to
colaborate, by getting to those sites and providing their
maintainers with the necessary data for updating their records.


--------------------
Project notes update
--------------------

Now it states dillo's HTML parsing policy (worth reading).

I've started moving dillo slowly to gtk+2, but working without CVS

Is it possible to get a branch from say dillo 6.0 for the port ?

I'm currently fixing this inside of <PRE> tags. It has to do with

This is bad coding style -- it's a kluge, not a fix.

The problem is that search sequence for fonts is arbitrary, and ISO10646
fonts can appear before ISO8859 fonts. Gtk doesn't handle ISO10646
fonts properly, hence the resolution problems.

The fix I've applied is to hardcode the font encoding into the font
search string in dw_style.c.

Naturally, this is non-portable coding.

I'll leave implementation to you, options might include taking encoding
data from build options, the environment, or getting a fix into Gtk.

Patch is from 0.6.0.

There is a USE_TABLES #define in html.c. I just experimented exchanging
it with a preferences variable (prefs.render_tables), and it seems to work
fine. I can change dillo back to old behaivor by editing dillorc. But there 
is currently no way of changing it on the fly, although
i would be willing to add a "Settings" menu to dillo where you could

[Dillo-dev]table rendering etc. on the ipaq

From: Sam J. Engstrom <sam@ne...> - 2001-08-13 23:56

As some of you have noticed, I've been providing arm binaries of dillo 
for use on the ipaq. They can be found along with notes and source at 
http://www.hut.fi/~sengstro/ipaq.html . Dillo is widely used on linux 
ipaqs because there aren't really that many good alternatives. It's 
advantages over konqueror/embedded have been speed, size and the fact 
that it has relentlessly mangled pages to fit the screen.

However, with recent table rendering most pages require dubious sideways 
scrolling. That's why I propose there should be an option (preferably 
selectable on the currently viewed page) to disable table rendering and 
fit everything except wide pictures to the window width. As you can't 
select text or anything, panning the page by dragging from unlinked 
areas could also be helpful.

I once wrote a script to translate html pages to wml (for wap phones), 
and found that it was often usable enough to provide a list of links to 
different frames from the frameset. This could be a short term solution 
before actually implementing frame support and it could remain as a 
useful (at least on the ipaq) option.

I personally would also find support for basic authentication useful 
because of my intranet, but I assume it's not a very high priority.

The changes I've actually done for the ipaq version:
- removed the home, save, url clear and progress buttons/boxes from the 
toolbar to get it to fit on the screen
- bound mouse button 1 to the popup menu when not on links
These could maybe be configurable options as well.

I regret my time is consumed by other work and can't pursue these 
improvements myself.

As far as I've understood, this is not quite conforming to the
specifications, but I haven't found anything about word-wrap, only
about clipping. However, since IMHO, this HTML code does not make any
sense, I thought of a workaround, which ignores the NOWRAP in this
case, in Html_tag_open_table_cell:

/* text style */
old_style = html->stack[html->stack_top].style;
style_attrs = *old_style;
- if (Html_get_attr(tag, tagsize, "nowrap", attrbuf, sizeof(attrbuf)))
+ if (Html_get_attr(tag, tagsize, "nowrap", attrbuf, sizeof(attrbuf)) &&
+ !Html_get_attr(tag, tagsize, "width", attrbuf, sizeof(attrbuf)))
style_attrs.nowrap = TRUE;
else
style_attrs.nowrap = FALSE;

Intended as a subject of further discussions.

Table support is why I installed dillo instead of laughing at it in
futility :) Like i have for every other version.

Once you have table support, you're on the way to becoming a functional
and useful browser.

I planned some changes to make Gtk-Dw-Gtk-Dw-... embedding simpler,
something like

GtkDwViewport
`- DwPage
`- DwEmbedGtk
`- GtkButton
`- GtkEmbedGtkSimple
`- DwPage

GtkEmbedGtkSimple is then a widget with the same purpose of
GtkDwViewport, but without scrolling. I've thought of an interface
between the toplevel Dw widget and the Gtk widget embedding it,
implemented by GtkDwViewport, GtkEmbedGtkSimple, and perhaps some
other widgets, e.g. for the reuse of Dw within a graphical plugin.

Of course, a simple solution could be to omit the GtkButton, and
handle the DwPage like a huge link. You can also set an outset border
around it, look at Html_open_img for details how to do this.

That's indeed a bug lying a bit deeper. When a widget represents a
HTML element (e.g. DwImage / <IMG>), the allocation of a widget is the
whole element space, including margin, border, and padding, not only
the content. What WIDTH and HEIGHT stand for is not very clear in

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#h-13.7.1

but the CSS spec is more precise, as in

http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-width

width and height specify the _content_ size. This was actually handled
wrong before by Dw, and is fixed now. (At least halfway, there will be
some changes, and, I hope, simplifications on this topic.)

Yes. I've inserted a modified version.

Sure.

First, beware that current code doesn't have any memory
management for the cache. Improving it by implementing a memory
boundary would be an important addition; it requires some
experience and a significant effort though.

The main contributor to memory usage is the dicache. It holds
the RGB decodings of the original formats (sometimes near to 3:1
ratio). Flushing it doesn't lose any images, because they're also
stored in the original format. It just adds decoding time to the
next pass.

Easy solution:

* Add an 'use_dicache' item to dillorc (YES/NO), and flush the
dicache when images are not being displayed (beware of multiple
browser windows).

Intermediate solution:

* Add a memory boundary for the dicache, and flush it
accordingly.

Long term solution:

* Add a memory boundary to the cache, and manage it with a
frequency heuristic (for instance).
Add a memory boundary to the dicache too.
Don't cache downloads.

Example dillorc:

cache_size=4Mb
use_dicache=YES
dicache_size=5Mb



Anyone? ;)

Sorry, but I can't reproduce it here.
Does it happen when closing with the window manager, or with
Ctrl-W, or both?
What does dillo report?
Does it happen only with slashdot or with any page?
What do you do afterwards?

Thanks a lot for you helping will, but I'm afraid that dillo
is not simple even for the experienced C programmer...

[Generic answer]

Anyway, if you can add a vertical scroller to the pagemarks (or
the same hack of selection boxes), that'd be a good start. Making
the focus "tend" to the main page is certainly a need.

Most recent emails in the list have several suggestions too;
read them!

One of the most appreciated things for a developer is a GOOD
bug report (that's what the Bug-Track is for). If it becomes a
complain list, is useless, but a careful bug report is a bless;
and precisely now, we're short of quality entries...

Finally (I assume you read the home page), if you have
additional skills (as SGML, HTTP, sockets, rpc, threads, ...)
it'd be good to know in order to suggest a more specific task.

[Dillo-dev]Tiny memory leak with DilloImages (and HRuler proposal)

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2001-08-13 03:04

Hello!

Jorge, I've been chasing, what seems to be, a tiny (rare) memory
leak in the Html_tag_open_img(). It allocates a DilloImage (with
a_Image_new()). I believe this gets freed with the a_Dicache_close()
or on abort with a_Dicache_callback(). I was trying local browsing and
I think this might be causing some leakage, when the image is _not_
found. If the image is not found, it doens't get an dicache entry,
right? So this DilloImage is never freed... If my reasoning is
somewhat correct, than this should free those DilloImages:

+ a_Image_close(Image);
a_Url_free(url);
}

-----------

Or some other, more generic, mechanism...

About the HRulers in Dillo, they have been bugging a bit. It seems
that they don't create some space around them, and therefore renders
some pages in a "tight" manner. Take for instance the Dillo home page
(dillo.s...net), the main links are placed within <hr>'s but look too
tightly pakced together. Does anyone know what the specs say about
<hr>'s? Because, I think, normally browsers insert some space before
and after the <hr>'s, and that's why nobody does this explicitly.
Switching the a_Dw_page_linebreak() with a_Dw_page_parbreak() in the
Html_tag_open_hr() code makes the <hr>'s nicer for me.. some thing
like:

[Dillo-dev]GLib-ERROR in Dw_image_scale()

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2001-08-12 07:52

Hello!

I'm trying to get to the root of an GLib-ERROR (while allocating) in
Dw_image_scale(). The problem arises when either h or w become
negative (because Dw_style_box_diff_{width,heith} is greater than
allocation.{width,ascent+descent}). This will cause a call to g_malloc
with a negative value. Since malloc's expect an unsgined value, the
negative value translate to a _very_ big allocation.

I noticed this while browsing, and since it has become consistent on
a certain page I took the minimal case out of the page. The original
page was: http://www.livrariacultura.com.br/ but since it changes with
frequency, I copied it to:

http://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/test-crash/
(the offending image is at):
http://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/test-crash/imagem/capas1/590425.jpg

It's kind of awkward how allocation.ascent+allocation.descent==0...
I tried to track down the *_size_allocate_request's but I still can't
fully understand what's missing :(

Sebastian, do you know what's up? This following patch, prevents the
glib error, but doesn't do the right thing :-(

Maybe even when this is fixed, a check for negative values here,
might be a good idea....

Oh, nice. I'm glad to hear... maybe I'll send it to Jorge, after
looking at it again and convincing myself it'll work. :)

You've touched an issue which I was going to address later on. But
here we go! It's been a little while since I've been using Dillo as
my main browser, and what I notice is that after a few hours of
browsing, Dillo has so much stuff in the cache, it uses as much memory
as Netscape at startup (which is a _lot_ :) Right now, for example,
Dillo is consuming around 15 Mb. If I start a new Dillo, it consumes
around 5 Mb (a little less). So more than 10Mb is being gobbled up by
the cache. What I do is exit Dillo and restart it again...

I think that this "clear cache", is a pretty good beginning for
resolving this issue... but a better way to do this (maybe later on
after discussing this better) is to let the user define the amount of
memory he wants Dillo to use _for cache_ (it's too hard and not
worthwhile to maintain global memory usage, just cache memory usage is
enough, IMHO). I imagine this would only have an affect on cache and
dicache modules, and nowhere else in Dillo.

Jorge, do you have any thoughts on this? 

I was thinking of implementing the cache item list as FIFO (simple
to implement, but not so good results), or maybe use a LRU algorithm
(harder to code, but might result in better performance for the user,
cause the pages are, depending on the user, frequently "revisited"),
to dispose "old" stuff in the cache. So everytime you get a new
request which is not cached, and the cache has hit the max memory
(defined by user), then we throw away the "oldest" cache entry to make
room for the new stuff. Of course, this wouldn't have to be a _strict_
limit, just something to aim for.

Well, just throwing some ideas...

Re: [Dillo-dev]Entry point of HTML before the renderer

From: DraX <drax@wh...> - 2001-08-12 06:12

I just patched with the big-small patch. It seems to pass the html suite
quite well, and renders why sites that use it mininally well also. I'm
also using the case sensitivity patch, sense it's my bug *grin* 

This might be a nice feature, a "clear cache" switch which will flush the
cache, for one reason or another.

Well, I have an _old_ implementation of them here if you want to
take a look at it. I never released them at the time, 'cause I thought
somebody had a already working patch for that. They seem to work
pretty well with Eric's font-styles.html test page. But feel free to
modify them if you like, or start a brand new implementation. Oh, and
I cheated, and build both the small and big tags in one "general"
function. 

The patch is at:
http://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/big_small_font.diff

I keep a list of my not-yet-inserted-in-Dillo-patches at:
http://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/

These aren't in Dillo yet, because they are still too
crappy^h^h^h^h^h^hexperimental or Jorge hasn't had time to look at
them.. (or both ;-)

Me too, me too! :) And if you do try to this, make a "Refresh Image"
option.. sometimes the whole isn't downloaded, and I would like to
refresh that image so it downloads completely, and since at the moment
refreshing the current page won't refresh the images in the dicache
(and I'm not really sure that it should.. should it?), this function
would come in very handy.

best regards to all!

I found that adding new html tags and attributes support be the easiest
(especially if you don't know much about gtk), and the io/cache side to be the
hardest.

Unfortunatly (!), almost all tags are now supported, except <big> and <small>,
and some form elements involving images. 

The big and small is quite easy to do, but not much used in tables, so we never
felt the need to implemented them so far. For a test page:
http://www.rti-zone.org/dillo/Html.testsuite/font_styles.html

Form elements can be trickier, but the need for them is higher. For test pages:
http://www.rti-zone.org/dillo/Html.testsuite/form.html (see submit button
with image and button), should not be that hard to implement.
http://maps.yahoo.com (search for a city, and you're supposed to see an image
server-side map in an submit button), this one is hard.

You can also try to torture dillo with all sort of tables and see if they are
rendered correctly, and if not submit a patch to Sebastian.

One thing I wanted to have for a long time is a popup menu over an image
with the options "view image", "save image", "copy image location", and why not
a "copy image" to paste it into gimp.

But if you really want to try and implement the gziped pages, go ahead!

As you can see, there's plenty to do!

First of all, you have to read _all_ the documentation you can find in dillo
sources and on the web site.
Then, a good start for this problem could be to have a look at how the dicache
is called and how it handles the images, and do something similar with gzipped
pages.

However, this is not an easy task, and if your C skills are that limited, you
might want to train first by volunteering for something simpler.

Anyway, good luck with your coding. And if your stuck with a problem, don't
be shy and ask for help on the list, with or without publishing the half-cooked
patch you're working on.

[Dillo-dev]E-mail flood

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2001-08-10 14:42

Hi there!


Someday it was to happen, and it did. I have an email pile
that's near a hundred; this is too much to handle properly, so I
apologize for all the foreseable delays, and worst, for those
that may remain unanswered.

I started processing it prioritizing the queue. It will be
slow, but it works.

Please note that this is good news. Bad news would be to sit in
waiting for someone to get interested.

In the mean time, please try to be very concise in your emails,
and try to design them so a short answer keeps you going on
(whenever that's possible).

Inexisting, but willing to! :-)

If GTK+-2.0 is the one that will use unicode (UTF-8), then it
is definitively an step forward. If this is the case, or if the

Navigation is already provided, global history should be

Right there!

...but there's no entry. That's the problem! :)

(CVS also holds a tag for every commit, and dillo's ChangeLog
file, within CVS, is also a good place, but the main
information resource is the BugTrack).

Yeah, this is a cache related problem. It appears that the remote
server is returning that a the `Content-Length` of an image is 0 (I
think it's an advertisement GIF). And Cache_parse_header wasn't
expecting a 0 lengthed object.

This following patch "fixes" this situation (by simply checking for
0 values). And I also replaced the `atol()` to `strtol()`. Sorry
Jorge, but `atol()` makes me sick :( I have lost hours and hours of
debugging my programs, only to find that atol is kind of buggy. I
prefer strtol() a lot more! And I suggest that the all atoi()'s from
html.c be changed to strtol()'s too. Jorge, if you want I can make a
patch changing them! Just ask! (And please do! ;-)

Well, the patch is at:

[Dillo-dev]Color Patch

From: Scott Cooper <scott@ig...> - 2001-08-09 03:17

hey everyone

here's a patch that started out small and got a little bigger but it should be cool in this email.

there is this segfault bug in Colors.c (dillo 0.6.0):

} else if (g_strncasecmp (subtag, "0x", 2) == 0) {
cp = strchr (subtag, 'x');
ret_color = strtol(++cp, NULL, 16);
} else {

a color with a capital X ("0Xff0000", say) bombs it since the strcasecmp lets it through but the strchr returns NULL.

i noticed it only cos i ripped the color table into one of my own projects, but it exposed another issue:

in html, the color "#ff" should be red, but dillo does a strtol on hex colors and hence returns blue. to be correct, any hex color should be padded to the right with zeros to 6 chars. so "#ff7" should be parsed to 0xff7000, not 0xff7.

the patch below is only long 'cos it's more verbose than a strol and lets whitespace on either end of the hex string. you could just use the shift, but i like it loose...a cost of a few more lines of code lets a poorly written web page render ok.

i had a quick scan of the bug list and i couldn't find a reference to this...i don't know if it's that significant since most people use "#ff0000" when writing colours, but it could be responsible for some crazy crashes that don't have any obvious cause.

and anyway, my favourite feature of dillo is its stability so every hole should be plugged.

(this is my first patch, so fingers crossed...)

The page is right, we're wrong. I think I suggested that attributes be parsed

[Dillo-dev]I'm back (kind-of)

From: Eric GAUDET <egaudet@in...> - 2001-08-08 18:21

Hi all,
I've been very quiet lately, but I'm still around and still willing to work on
dillo. That means the bug-track entries I've been voluntreering for are still
on my list and I'll hopefully find some time soon to finish them all. But you
know what it is: new job, new country, ... a baby ... I've been quite busy ;-)

Anyway, here's what I wanted to say:

- Sebastian: awesome job you did with the tables !!! If you want to send me your
html test pages, I'll add them to the test suite right away.
I also wanted to remind everyone that you can send me the pages you built, or
you found, that are relevant for testing dillo, so I can integrate them in the
testing suite. This is especially true if you do a bug repport that asks to
"build such a page": build the damn page so everyone can test it!

- a friend of mine succesfully tested dillo on his SGI O2 running IRIX (after
compiling the gtk and the libpng, because the provided package was too old):
Jorge, you might want to add that to the plateforms repported to work :-)

Well, maybe. I try to restate, as I understand it. What you're talking
about, is keeping (global) history information per se; I just added
history (navigation in your parlance) _buttons_ and used the history
(navigation) information available.

So, I see this as two, maybe three, different items:
- keeping (global) history information
- keeping (local) navigation information
- and the user interface to this: history/navigation buttons

The second one is already available. I started the third one with my
history button patch; which leaves the first item to be done.

Does this means, there is already work done for the global history
list? If this is the case, the easiest would be, to integrate it into
CVS and extend the history buttons.

When I search for "history", I don't find any entry. So, where is the
place, I should look for this kind of information?

I suppose, sending patches qualifies as not being shy :-).

the beginning and click on a _new_ link of it, the rest of the
navigation stack will be lost (forward history). So, maybe
keeping an stack-independent ordered-list (ideally an ordered
hash) of every single visited-root-URL can do the trick, and
we'll never have to worry again about loosing stack info. That
way, we could have access to any previously visited URL without
worrying about the stack.

A skim through the code shows Nav_open_url as a good place for
inserting the new URL into the hash...

Yes!

If we keep the list ordered, the relative position of current
URL can be found within it. That position defines what is back
and what is forward!

Note that the navigation stack remains untouched.

I had been thinking of that before your patch!, but after
playing a while with your scheme, I liked it more!

URLs are appended to the list as they get visited. i.e. every
new URL is appended. If you go back, let's say to the midddle of
the "history", and click on a new link, it is equally appended to
the END of the list, thus defining a list that's ordered by
order-of-visit. On the other hand, if you follow already visited
links, they're NOT appended because they're already in the list.

(And as with the navigation stack, only RootUrls count).

It's interesting indeed, but I'd prefer to first implement the
simple scheme I described above, play with it, get a feel of it,
and then decide whether to improve it or not and how.

1 big history for all windows!

That way, the user can always count on back and forward history
to help him find where a lost visited-site has gone. And normal
back and forward will aid him with the latest sites.

I'll be looking forward to see it working!

[Dillo-dev]Attribute Parsing

From: Sebastian Geerken <sgeerken@st...> - 2001-08-07 16:45

Hi.

Most of you will remember the discussion on how to parse the HREF
attribute of the <a> tag. This is a similar problem: in

http://cvs.so....net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/dillo/

you'll find something like

<table width="100&#37;">

Dillo reads this as "100" (pixels) and complains about the garbage at
the end. I'm not an SGML expert, so I thought to post this to the
list. Have attributes to be be parsed generally, or is this page
invalid?

One way is to add them as widgets, as in the patch I've appended. To

The problem your seeing is that dillo _does_ cache every page (and
image) you download. That's probably why your feeling that it leaks. A
while ago, we've made efforts to get rid of the leaks in dillo. Even
though I think it leaks very little memory, it still leaks a bit (you
can experiment and keep doing Back and Forward between two pages
various times, and keep looking at dillo's memory usage).

But the problem your talking about is sort of registered as bug
#159 at
http://dillo.so....net/cgi-bin/bugtrack/Dillo_query.cgi?what=all&Submit=Find+It!

And about hard disk cache, I think it's pretty much covered in
`CACHE PHILOSOPHY` in dillo/doc/Cache.txt

I'd be interested in a simple way to highlight text: I've implemented the select
and copy mecanism (see bug-track), but I don't have time to do the highlighting
selection. If you can provide a patch that highlight the text found, make sure
it can be reused and send it to me.

[Dillo-dev]Memory Leakage

From: Aaron Lehmann <aaronl@vi...> - 2001-08-06 01:43

As I browse the web with dillo, the memory usage consistantly goes up.
Is it caching every page that it sees, or is there a memory leak? Can
the amount of memory cache to use be controlled? I've only run it up
to 5.55MB, but I assume it will keep growing.

The Find Text that's in CVS does a perfect job of finding text. The
only problem is that it doesn't show it to the user by highlighting
it! I assume you know about this. I can't wait until it does highlight
the text, because once that happens it will be easier to allow the

Are you looking for assistance with this feature? 



[Dillo-dev]Assorted dillo issues

From: Aaron Lehmann <aaronl@vi...> - 2001-08-06 01:32

1) I went to "view bookmarks", then bookmarked something, then looked at my
bookmark page again through "view bookmarks". I needed to reload to
get the new bookmark. This shouldn't be hard to fix.

2) Some pages like http://www.shared-source.com have a <?xml version="1.0"?>.
It appears in the body under dillo. What does the XHTML spec say about
this?

Well, it's intentional _and_ there are plans to incorporate this
into Dillo. This has been a long TODO feature that has been delayed
specially because of this was intended to be included as a Dillo
Plugin. Ask Jorge about this if you're interested in helping out.
First take a look at:

And most importantly:

happypenguin.org contains somewhere "<tr bgcolor=...>", this should be
simple to implement, and is already registered in the bug-track. (I
must admit that I had not noticed it in the spec, and thought that it
is a non-standard extension ;-)

http://www.so....net uses background *images* for this effect, I have
had some ideas how to implement this, and will sent them later to the
list.

I've looked at the page, and found

<TD WIDTH="380" ROWSPAN="2" NOWRAP>

nearly directly before the text. I'm not quite sure about the
specification (or if it is even clear in this case), but at least,
this is quite ambiguous. Dillo's current behavior is to use WIDTH
attributes only as hints; if the cell is wider (in this case due to
the NOWRAP argument), it is (more or less) ignored,

[Dillo-dev]word wrapping / page width

From: Ulrich Schwarz <uschwarz@gm...> - 2001-08-01 15:40

Hi,

since a month or so, the cvs version (including the latest 0.6 release) of
dillo doesn't wrap the text on http://futurezone.orf.at but instead
extends the page width to the longest text paragraph of that page so
that no word wrapping is done and each text paragraph is displayed in
a single (extremely long) text line.

Is this due to buggy html code on that page or due to a suboptimal
page width calculation of dillo?


So long.

This just rocks and shows that it is possible to have a nice

Good luck and keep on going with the same quality.

[Dillo-dev][PATCH] Recording current scrolling position

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2001-08-01 08:35

Hi guys!

Browsing around with Dillo, something started to irritate me.. the
fact that the `Back` and `Forward` buttons always place you at the
_top_ of the page, instead of the location you scrolled to when last
visiting that URL.

And since Jorge and I had planned the scrolling_position in the
DilloUrl exactly for this, I thought I give it a try...

The patch is at:
http://www.linux.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/save_scrolling_position.diff

It basically does 3 things:

[1] Add a a_Dw_gtk_scrolled_window_get_scrolling_position() method in
the dw_scrolled_window.[ch] module. I thought this was better than
having to access the vadjustment fields for the value explicitly.

[2] Saves the current scrolling position of the current viewed page
(using the method explained above). I had to triplicate the code in
Nav_url_open(), a_Nav_back() and a_Nav_forw(), because in the last 2
cases it is difficult to determine which is the `old_url`, and would
require some ugly special-case code (I might be wrong, but I couldn't
come up with a better/cleaner solution).

[3] Loads the current scrolling position of the chosen URL if
available (this is done in web.c). Why is this checked before the
anchor? Well because if you go to a anchored URL, but move the
position of the page, you don't want the page to go to the anchor
anymore, but prefer the page's last position. In the case that the
user hasn't changed the page position (therefore matching the anchor),
we then avoid a seek of the anchor inside the page, and avoid having
to calculate the adjustment... it has been already calculated, and
should be the value of url->scrolling_position.

The patch is small and im my opinion improves navigation in Dillo.
If there are no comments and/or critics, Jorge feel free to apply the
patch!

best regards to all,
