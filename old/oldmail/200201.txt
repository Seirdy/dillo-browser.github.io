Re: [Dillo-dev]Ditching pthreads

From: Sam Dennis <sam@ma...> - 2002-01-31 23:22

Some time around 8 o'clock PM on January 31, a Thursday, Sam Dennis wrote many
things about using GIOChannels in file.c to replace pthreads without first
trying to implement it and therefore overlooking the inadequacy of GIOChannels
with regard to detecting EOF and the fact that we already use them in http.c.
This shows that the statement most likely to be true in the message was about
him not being an expect on dillo's IO subsystem. He still holds that we don't
need threads, though.

If you refer to compiling on *BSD systems, I was looking into this.
Here is a patch that should make compilation on FreeBSD - and possibly
the others - easier :

Of course, now you have to run autoconf again. It needs some
testing, though. I only tested on FreeBSD so far.

Now, this is *only* *compiling* ...

[Dillo-dev]Ditching pthreads

From: Sam Dennis <sam@ma...> - 2002-01-31 20:30

Since it (pthreads if you missed the subject line) appears to be causing so
many problems on unusual systems, why not just remove it?

I'm no expert on our IO subsystem but we already rely on glib, which has a
very handy-looking thing called a GIOChannel. We could, of course, manage
without it but it's there so why not use it?

Of course, I haven't thoroughly scrutinised the code so it may be that there's
some deeply profound reason for using threaded IO, but I doubt it.

The only other thing we seem to use pthreads for is asynchronous DNS lookups,
and that is optional but could be handled with, off the top of my head, a
forked process. 



Re: [Dillo-dev]dillo on *BSD

From: Andreas Schweitzer <andy@ph...> - 2002-01-31 16:43

Hi again,

I've been looking in making ports for FreeBSD and OpenBSD
and maybe NetBSD ;-). It seems, there is already something
happening and NetBSD seems to have a port/package !:

NetBSD :
http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/www/dillo/
I have also found ports to Handhelds and whatnot ;-):
http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-hpcmips/2001/12/
(this is for the MIPS HP/C handhelds like the Cassiopeias)

FreeBSD work in progress :
http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=33122

OpenBSD work in progress :
http://www.monkey.org/openbsd/archive/ports/0109/msg00198.html
http://www.monkey.org/openbsd/archive/ports/0110/msg00001.html

I'll probably look into this in more detail on the weekend.
But the patches they apply should already help.

Cheers,
Andreas

[Dillo-dev]Start-up time and gtk_set_locale()

From: Pekka Lampila <medar@ka...> - 2002-01-31 16:22

Hi,

(Ah, I'm finally able to post here, after changing my SMTP server)

I've been thinking if it would be possible to reduce Dillo's start-up
time, so I tested few things.

If I place return 0; before gtk_main() in dillo.c, average runtime is
about 2.5 seconds. (When no window manager is running). After removing
gtk_set_locale() the average time is only about 1.8 secs.
(My machine is P133 with 72mb of RAM)

gtk_set_locale was added in 0.6.2. So maybe problems that were fixed by
it could be dealt with some other way?

On the other hand this sounds like the kind of thing that could be
"fixed" by GTK 2.0 ...

Keep up the good work. :)

Makes no real difference with me. I can use both - yet both just
once. And that *only* happens in the checked out CVS tree, not 
in the final distributions.

My guess would be yes, you need to use gmake, as OpenBSD is pretty
similiar to NetBSD and OpenBSD's BSD make will fail.

Re: [Dillo-dev]*BSD and dillo's configure

From: Imad <magius@pu...> - 2002-01-31 12:14

Hi!

Running configure as follows worked for me on my SPARCstation 5/OpenBSD
3.0:

LIBS="-pthread " ./configure --with-jpeg-inc=/usr/local/include

However, although gmake can compile the source, Dillo repeatedly
core-dumps. It opens up the "about" page fine but as soon as I ask it to
fetch another page, boom! core dump:


Setting locale to C
dillo_dns_init: Here we go!
Loading bookmarks...
Nav_open_url: Url=>about:splash<
Nav_open_url: Url=>http://dillo.so....net/ChangeLog.html<
pid 32387: Fatal error p' at line 573 in file (errno = 0)
1;2c

It does seem possible to sometimes get through to a text-only page, but
even that occurs very, very rarely. I *know* Dillo isn't this buggy --
old versions didn't die nearly this easily, and Dillo's gotten better
with time, so I'm pretty sure that it's a configuration/compile problem,
likely with pthreads.

Hmmh, before installing the pthread library from NetBSD I just had=20
to tweak about four lines in the source and kick out on superflous
include to get things going without pthreads. But.. oh, I guess
that hack had influences on the file->save behaviour.

[Dillo-dev]Dillo on NetBSD

From: Bjoern Weber <foxbow@we...> - 2002-01-31 10:00

Just for the records. After I installed the pthreads package and
linked the jpeg and png libs down to /usr/lib the 0.6.4 version
compiles from scratch, running like a charm.

Unfortunately I can't compile the cvs without tweaking.
First of all I need to touch depmod in the root directory
then I need to copy config.h into the src/IO directory.

Another funny thing is the fact that I can compile only once.
If I try a second make, it bombs out, complaining about
defective AMDEP lines in the Makefile. I suppose that my
automake is outdated, yet shouldn't configure notice that?

This all was tested on a SUN SparcStation 5 running under 
NetBSD 1.5.2

If my descriptions were too vague just send me a note and I'll
retry it at home (actually at work, typing from memory)

Greetings,
Bjoern

P.S.: The QNX x86 0.6.4 runs better than the 0.6.3 I'm about
to make an official statement about that.

On OpenBSD you add -pthreads and it works, if memory serves that does

I think, these warnings come from make, but I'm used to them. And yes,

assuming that Jorge patched the LIBJPEG_INCDIR problem, then you should 
only need:

./configure --with-jpeg-include=/usr/local/include and all should be well 
with *compiling*, then you have to go back and fix the makefile to fixup 
the link problem by adding -lc_r to the LFLAGS *if* it's FreeBSD 
4.4-RELEASE or earlier.

then you get a bunch of warnings about insecure uses of mktmp() and other

1) I had a success running configure in a following way:

./configure --with-jpeg-inc=/usr/local/include

(without --with-jpeg-inc configure didn't find the jpeg headers)

2) build succeeded. Still doesn't work with BSD make, though. (Automake
creates makefiles with some gmake specific things. One example is the
include directive, which supports including multiple files with one
directive with gmake, but doesn't with bsd make.)

Additionally, I think GTK_CONFIG should also be set. I've compiled a lot
of autoconf/automake programs before and got bored with gtk-config. At
least under my FreeBSD 4.2, the file is actually called gtk12-config, so
I've created a symlink to make configure work.

[Dillo-dev]dillo on *BSD

From: Andreas Schweitzer <andy@ph...> - 2002-01-30 15:24

Hi everybody,

Jorge, as you asked for some BSD fixes here it goes.

There are 2 main things that could help a lot :

1. All the libs like jpeg anf gtk etc. live in /usr/local
(/usr/local/lib /usr/local/include and /usr/local/bin/gtk-config)
This is standard on all *BSD's. So, I think if autoconf/automake etc.
simply starts looking in /usr/local/ then things should improve
significantly. (I am not that familiar with these tools, sorry)
2. The trheads require the
-lc_r
switch instead of -lpthread .... beats me .... at least on FreeBSD.
I'll check the other *BSD's eventually.

BTW, there is a port of dillo0.4 in /usr/ports/www in FreeBSD. This
gave away quite a bit ;-) ....

So far, I usually got dillo compile on the *BSD's if I include a lot
of things like LD_PATH=..... or --with-jpeg-lib=..... GTK_CONFIG=.....

[Dillo-dev]*BSD and dillo's configure

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2002-01-30 14:17

Hi BSDers!

Within my email collection :), I have several references to
problems with *BSD, in what regards to jpeg-library-detection and
pthreads.

Dillo 0.6.4 has a new check for jpeg library that seems to be
working (at least here and in some other machines where the
problem was present before). Those of you that had problems with
it, please test and report how it goes.

The pthreads library problem is more complex. As I wrote
before:

> AFAIU detecting and configuring is automake&autoconf work (they
> generate configure). So, I'd suggest to get a few pthreaded SW
> packages, that use autoconf stuff, and see how do they solve
> the problem in *BSD.

I don't know if the latest version solves it...
BTW: it would be very good to test with FreeBSD-4.5! too.


Sometime ago Sammy sent me a big patch (60Kb aprox) that solved
the pthread library detection. I'm reluctant to include such a
big patch, specially knowing that 'configure' already takes 120Kb

Maybe there's a smaller solution that can do it. As a custom
test in configure.in for instance (just an idea).

I was also reported that:

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2002-01-30 14:17

Hi there,

Sourceforge didn't update the download page, so I redirected
our download links (from dillo's home page) to the place it can
be found (at SF).

Agh, I really feel like moving...


Sorry for the inconvenience

Hi folks!

As you may have noticed, dillo-0.6.4 has been released a few
hours ago. For those of you that haven't tried it yet, it brings
some new features and bugfixes. As always, my advice is:

Go get it!

Re: [Dillo-dev]Dillo plans for 2002

From: Jonathan P Springer <jonathan.springer@ve...> - 2002-01-29 23:24

All,

Thanks Jorge for the informative information on priorities for Dillo in
2002. I've enjoyed the time I've spent hacking around back in the I/O
engine. After my first abortive attempt at SSL ran into trouble with
proxies, I settled back to try it again, this time with tunnelling.

The resultant patch is at
http://members.bellatlantic.net/~mze2mqqv/dillo-ssl-cookies.2002-01-27.diff
. I'm posting it to the list, but

!!!THIS IS NOT A PATCH FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!!!

I ended up reorganizing 90% of the I/O engine code, the wisdom of which,
in retrospect, I'm unsure. For those who want to try it out, download
the CVS dillo and download the patch into dillo's root directory. Then:

$ cd ~/Projects/dillo # or wherever
$ curl http://members.bellatlantic.net/~mze2mqqv/dillo-ssl-cookies.2002-01-27.diff
$ patch -p1 -i ./dillo-ssl-cookies.2002-01-27.diff
$ automake -a
$ autoconf
$ ./configure --enable-ssl
$ make
$ ./src/dillo https://www.so....net/

(I love that test case because sourceforge does a redirect at its root.)

I've tested the patch for wwwoffle as a proxy. I'll be putting it
through a stress test and memory leak tests this weekend. I appreciate
any bug reports or comments; even if this patch never sees the light of
day, it was challenging and rewarding to code. Documentation can be
found in 'dillo/doc/GByteArray-IO.txt'.

It also got me to thinking about your "simple plugins", Jorge, although
I don't have much history. I'll hit the mailing list archives and web
site later to get some. By the time I was down with this patch, I was
establishing "chain-stacks" for all operations. Expressing 'a_Http_ccc'
as 'Http' for example, the stacks went something like this:

Http: Cache<->Http<->IO<->DNS
Http (proxy): Cache<->Http<->Proxy<->DNS
Https: Cache<->Http<->Https<->BIO<->DNS
Https (proxy): Cache<->Http<->Https<->Tunnel<->BIO<->DNS
About: Cache<->About
File: Cache<->File<->IO

While I hardcoded the chains in an array in 'a_Url_get_ccc_chain', it
certainly seems possible that given a scheme (e.g. 'ftp') a chain could
be loaded from a symbol ('a_Dillo_Plugin_Chain'?) in an appropriate plugin 
(e.g. 'ftp.so') and executed. What I'm not clear on is how much additional 
access to the core dillo symbol table might be required. Are there security 
concerns? And so on... I'll read the mailing list archives before I bore 
you with questions.

Regards,
-jonathan springer

I am still here!!! :)

I had a very late 2001 and am still having a
very turbulent early 2002 in Real Life(tm)... ranging
from getting through the bureaucracy of getting a
bank to finance an appartment to me, through moving
to the new appartment and more recently having a close
relative with a delicate health problem.

I am still on forced "vacations" from almost all
my Free Software activities, but I can still help on the
move to cipsga, even if only to put you in touch
with the guys who can actively do it. :)

I owe a new package of dillo to the familiar=20
distribution to the iPAQ... we are still in 0.6.2 there... :(

[Dillo-dev]Dillo plans for 2002

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2002-01-29 15:17

Hi there!


I've been longing to write this email almost from the first
week of this year, but I didn't know where (or how) to start, and
sort a huge myriad of unrelated things.

This year began with a hectic pace for dillo. Although the
mailing list has show moderate traffic, my INBOX holds more than
a hundred emails, and there're a lot of topics pending.

The only way to cope with all of them, would be to multiplex
myself (or clonning ;), but as I'm not able (nor willing) to do
either, I'll use the well known "priority list" method to try to
start moving it. Please note that this method has its flaws: as
not being able to handle every task, the scheduling problems that
arise when new, very important, topics spring-in and "non
maskarable interrupts", to name a few.

The good new is that I've munched the 100+ emails into a 30
points list, and I'll try to start unrolling it. I say try,
because is not easy to handle an issue to another person when
he/she is not convinced of doing it. OTOH, it also happens that
after a lot of discussion, that person convinces me his way!

NOTE: some emails will be terribly procrastinated, and some
others will remain unanswered. This is not the way I like it, but
I _can't_ answer all of them. This warning should be at the web
site, but that task has a lower priority than this mail... :(
You have been warned.

NOTE2: well thought, and informed emails (or posts), are easier
to answer (and strongly encouraged), because I don't have to dig
for information the poster could have got alone.
Let me advice not to post your first thought on any matter, but
to inform yourself, consider alternatives, give it a second
analysis, and post back your well reasoned/backed ideas.

NOTE3: There's plenty of information at the web site, and those
asking for things already answered there (or in the docs), will
not be answered.


****************


Let's start with these:

* 0.6.4 release
* Move from SourceForge
* Simple plugins
* cookies
* SSL
* external viewers/programs/handlers


* 0.6.4 release ****

Almost ready! It'll be mainly a bugfix release (segfaults on
imagemaps) with some nice additions (aligning, remembering of
page-scrolling-position, ...).

Most probably Jan 30.


* Move from SourceForge ****

This had a long thread, and when it was about to be done,
Eduardo M. Ma=E7an, vanished !? I made repeated attempts to reach
him (yes, with intervals), but got no answer.

Does anyone here know how to get in touch with him?
Eduardo: Cad=E9 voc=EA?


* Simple plugins ****

Some time ago (long), Eric and I were working steadily on this.
Simple plugins could be a _very_ powerful tool for dillo,
provided careful design and a considerable amount of work is put
on it.

In brief, "simple plugins" operate very much like a CGI, but
without a web server, and they also provide a tiny API that
broadens a bit their scope. They're _NOT_ like Netscape plugins.

The point is they could handle bookmarks, preferences, FTP,
downloads and extensibility in a customizable way.

If it's so great why aren't you working on it?
Believe me, if I had a twin brother, he'd be working on it!

In practise, a lot of expertise and knowledge is required to
contribute here. Mainly: CGI/fastCGI, HTML, protocol design,
interprocess comunnication, deep CCC knowledge, and general dillo
UI knowledge.

Suitable volunteers would be a bless.

The second problem is that if I start working on this, all of
my other duties get stalled... I plan to move some high priority
tasks first, and when they're going to restart the plugins.

NOTE: human "context switches" take lots of time.



* Cookies ****

J=F6rgen has just sent me the patch that solves almost every
known problem for reviewing. Don't expect it on 0.6.4.

Cookies is a very sensible topic in what regards to security,
and privacy. So, appart form the quality/completeness/ review, it
_must_ be tested against "cookie abuse".

Those of you using it, please test it thoroughly (a few google
searches will bring enough material to get you started.), and
report back your results.


* SSL ****

This will be focused most probably after cookies.

As some perspicacious developers had noted, there were several
tasks aiming to prepare dillo for SSL (mainly on HTML and URL
parsing).

It becomes evident that when dillo is SSL enabled, people will
start to do some "sensible" work with it, and reliability starts
to play a primary role.

Currently, it's very easy to hack-in some SSL support, but when
you start using it, you don't want a long and important "session"
to suddenly end in a segfault, or submitting wrong values.

Be careful.

Also bear in mind that the first SSL-enabled dillo will set a
major milestone, and will generate a lot of feedback. Let's take
our time and do it right!


* external viewers/programs/handlers ****

I have at least three implementation ideas (with code) for such
ad-hoc functionality waiting for a review.

Please also note that the "official" idea is to handle all this
stuff with "simple-plugins", but considering that SPI has become
a sort of highly-desirable-vaporware :), it may not be a bad idea
to choose one of these for the interim.

Hi Sebastian,
I've been trying to make the page selection for copy and paste, but I
encountered some problems due to the fact that there is several 'words' arrays:
one for each DW (table cells).
Do you plan to implement some sort of DOM methods on top of the DWs, so one
can 'walk' the page structure?
What's your recommendation for that in the current implementation?

[Dillo-dev]Dillo and GTK+ 2.0pre

From: Michael Krueger <lcarsvision@we...> - 2002-01-28 18:59

Hi,

I compiled GTK+ 2.0pre (aka 1.3.11) with both the linux-fb and directfb port. 
My goal is to write a small Linux/GNU distribution which fits on two floppies 
and includes GUI applications. But compiling Dillo v0.6.3 (which would be the 
included browser) seems to be not possible, even after handcoding fixes in 
configure for pkg-config and the source. src/IO is compiled without any 
problems, but the dw* framework files make gcc-2.95 stop. There are many 
irrelationships with GtkArg{GetFunc,SetFunc} ("function not found") and klass 
("structure: no member 'klass'"). I don't know how to fix these problems, the 
GTK+ migration manual does not offer useful information.
Has somebody ported Dillo to GTK+ 2.0pre? Or has somebody ideas to fix those 
problems?

Best regards,
Michael Krueger

I have been working on a design for CSS support the last time, I'll
soon write it down and send it to the list (there are still some
things I want to clear first). There are different aspects, which are,
independent of each other, quite complex:

- CSS parsing and evaluating itself,
- interaction with the HTML parser,
- mapping on the actual rendering, and
- the actual rendering.

About the last two points: There is already a structure, DwStyle,
handling some CSS attributes (e.g. the ones you mentioned), but some
attributes affect the DwWidget structure itself (see doc/Dw*.txt in
the tarball). Whether they are supported or not (the latter is likely
in the first release-ready implementation) should be hidden, so that
it can be added in the future (even perhaps(!) up to XML/CSS
rendering).

If you look at the code, the actual rendering is already more and more
improved to handle things like CSS boxes, alignments etc.

There will be several tasks, on which different people may work on.

This behaviour is (currently) given by Gtk+, which determines the tab
order (which is the order in which widgets were added to a parent
widget). AFAIK, Gtk+ 2.0 provides better ways to customise this.

This is actually not a table problem. :-)

Yes, http://validator.w3.org shows some errors (also on tables), but
the main problem seems to be lists. You can show them in a more
debuggable way by replacing "#if 0 " in Html_add_indented_widget into
"#if 1". I haven't yet examined if this is the fault of dillo, or of
the page.

Well, there are some problems, and tables will undergo major changes
in the future.

I think at first you need to check syntax of the pages and whether it
uses unsupported functionality by dillo.
You know, there are many invalid pages on the Net. And from my
experience, dillo table renderer has little problem basically. 
If you find the pages are correct then report the problem.

[Dillo-dev]CSS support under development ?

From: Teemu Voipio <mystran@wa...> - 2002-01-24 05:59

I think that having at least some basic CSS support

font-size, text-aling, color,
background-color, background (?)
margins, paddings, borders,
to begin with (and implement more when these work)

would really be nice improvement to this great browser and wouldn't
necessarily need to compromise any of it's speed as most of the code
needed to actually "draw" these things are actually simple or implemented
for HTML anyway.

And do it right from the beginning (ie. cascade them as supposed so we
don't end up with something like Netscape 4).

If nobody is doing this I can start developing the CSS parsing and
cascading and when I get the properties listed above (or something)
working reliably, start implementing them into the renderer.

Any interest ?

[Dillo-dev]Dillo 0.6.3 + bunch of patches ?

From: Teemu Voipio <mystran@wa...> - 2002-01-24 01:32

This browser is great but latest release 0.6.3 (?) is very old.

There are patches available to do this and that (including cookies etc.).
Not all of these patches apply to the 0.6.3.

Is anybody in the business of trying to bring together any new releases
that include (some of the most stable and urgent of) those patches with
it already applied. That would make it a lot easier for people interested

Actually, that breaks the binary search :(, the fix is:

I ran into a slight segfault in dillo: go to http://volnorm.so....net.
The problem is that an invalid color is used as table background:

Anyway, just replace:

I gave it a full review, and commited a new patch to the CVS.
Please check it out and test it through beacause I haven't a

The main reasons for the new approach were:

- use the opportunity to clean up the proxy code.
- the patch implementation wasn't optimized for speed.

[Dillo-dev]Segfault on image maps (BUG 277)

From: Johannes Hofmann <Johannes.Hofmann@gm...> - 2002-01-19 11:59

Hi, 

current dillo seems to have a problem with image maps (see BUG 277).
I think the problem is that within a_Url_set_ismap_coords() in url.c
it is assumed that u->path points to a position within u->buffer.
But then a_Url_set_ismap_coords() makes u->path point to a position
within u->url_string->str. So at the next call to
a_Url_set_ismap_coords() things go wrong.
The attached check seems to solve the problem for me.

Just as an aside, the tab behavior seems to be based on the order the elements
were encountered in the html, not the order in which they occur 
top-bottom,left-right on the screen. This comes into play when two separate
forms are rendered side-to-side by the table logic. For example, at the
Sourceforge login, I need to tab twice to get from username to password because
there's an independant dropdown list in the bar to their right.

I know table processing is still in its infancy, but it's a behavior to keep
in mind.

Most interfaces I've seen allow TAB to go to the next field, as does Dillo
currently. Thus I don't see why Enter should be used for that. In
addition, it is common in both other browsers and in all kinds of dialogs
to have Enter submit everything.

Also, most places send you back to the input if there's something missing.

Well, if javascript is not supported, then it's not supported. I have yet
to meet a place where I could submit but javascript was the only check on
the validity of the data.

That might be sensible. I dunno... quite a few forms make sense when
half-filled and then Enter is a blessing (keeps you offa the mouse).

This would be a really nice feature. It would get around those silly
no-submit inputs.

I might. Right now I'm looking at proper frames -- was thinking about

nice. Reverse DwGtkEmbed, anyone?

The point is that when facing multiple input fields, the form
may be submitted incomplete as a result of pressing enter after
filling one text entry (almost a reflex-act these days).

There's also another reason: as javascript is not supported,
and as it's often used to verify form submitions, it becomes very
important not to try to send an incomplete form.

Well, that's the idea behind it, but in practice, I must
recognize that after some tests, the current implentation is
certainly lacking, and that forms without submit, send whatever
they have (or not) at enter-press time. Certainly not the desired
effect...

There's also the issue of input types that don't generate enter
presses (as selection boxes); when they lack a submit. Current
code doesn't submit anything, and as you noticed, the SPECS don't
throw any light on that.

It'd be very handy to fix all these annoyances at once. I
think:

When there's a submit:

- Only submit on enter when there's a single enter-press
generating input ('text' and 'password').
Note: this can be further constrained to "one and only one
single enter-press input", but it may be overkill...


When there's no submit:

- If there's more than one single enter-press input, render the
submit (added internally), and apply the above rules.


If you're willing to implement this idea, please let me know.
If not, volunteers are welcome ;). Note that this is not complex
and very suitable for those of you that feel like helping.

Consider a document that says

Not necessary. It runs as the user, and can only do things the user

And looking at the plugins facility, 90% of the work to add CGI is
already there.

I made the exact same suggestion once, only I forgot to
send it to the list (default reply is to sender). I did
send it to the guy that mentioned working on preferences:

...

I was wondering if there was a way to keep the
preferences screens, etc., out of dillo. To do
this, I came up with the following idea:

Create an interface for local executables
Secure this "local-CGI" to prevent malicious use.
Build a preferences editor as one of these local-CGIs.
Screens in HTML, write results to "~/.dillo/dillorc"

This would mean that the only thing added to dillo
is the ability to do this local-CGI thing. It could
also open up lots of other possibilities. Hmm, think
about a local-CGI that runs "locate"...

Of course, the preference screens would then have to
live with the limitations of HTML, but I don't think
that's a huge sacrifice.

I have a suggestion for configuring dillo: use a web form, and local

sorts of interesting uses of dillo. Maybe it could be done through a
plugin? e.g. cgi:/usr/lib/dillo/config.cgi

The cookies patch will do that. In the ~/.dillo/cookie_control file, add

There is a slim possibility that this fake javascript patch
will work for you. It supports URLs of the form:

javascript:somefunction(a,b,c,")

At the very least, this works for yahoo's links to it's slide
shows. See news.yahoo.com for examples.

Dear dillo hackers,

dillo is a great piece of software and I realy like it. Thanks to all who
develop it. When I first time tried dillo I was little confused about not
working CENTER flag, but late I got to used to it. I think it is not so bad
to have all stuff aligned to left especialy on small screens. Maybe iPAQ
users can say us more (hope soon I will be iPAQ user to :-). On small screen
you (maybe) can avoid some scroling with scroolbar to left. If that what I
am writing is true, maybe there could be option in cfg file. At the end let
me one question. Are there some plans for support of CCS or javascript ?

thanks again and best regards

Check out the latest CVS - CENTER is now supported.
It was checked in about a week ago.

[Dillo-dev]A few comments, suggestions, and reflections.

From: Paul <paul@sp...> - 2002-01-16 07:05

I love Dillo. I use it daily and dread the times when I am forced to crank
up the diesel engine called Mozilla for programs that require cookies,
ssl, java, flash, etc. (which is rare by the way) Before Dillo was thrown
into my lap I was using a script written by Hobbit (l0pht) powered by
netcat! The extra crap is cute and all but hardly worth the wait. With
Dillo I don't have to sacrifice speed for legibility.

I haven't looked at the cookies patches because frankly I haven't been
able to get any of the patches people have put out to work (except the
forms patch which is great!). Is it possible (I'm sure the answer is yes)
to include "imaginary cookies support?" To just placate the web servers
and accept the cookies but just hold them in memory (ccache.[ch]) until
Dillo is closed. There is really no need to keep them. Web pages don't
require that you have the cookie already, just that you are willing to
accept them.

Maybe this has been covered before and you can all fill my inbox with hate
mail if I'm beating a dead horse. But, why doesn't Dillo support the full
html code? It seems to me that that should be a primary concern. For
instance the <center> tag. Maybe it is more difficult than it sounds. I
haven't done any gui programming.

I love Dillo. I appreciate all the hard work everyone has put into it to
make it the fine browser it is. Because of the extensive documentation
and attention to detail I am learning a great deal about all aspects of
programming.

hi jonathan!

a bug report, at least with respect to my FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE setup:
one thing that i find myself having to do when i use your patches is to
manually add the new file name to the makefiles, ie https.c https.o,
etc...

and i lied when i said that having https was sufficient for me to do
online banking with my credit union. i needed cookies too :-)

it *still* doesnt work yet. adding cookies at least get's it past the

i should have checked for that earlier. :-(

This doesn't work for any proxy I tried (squid, wwwoffle).

https requests via http-proxies have to be implemented in a
different way, just like w3m handles them.

The configure script, while it checks for OpenSSL, seems to ignore the
results and happily try to compile for OpenSSL with headers and library
missing. Methinks specifying --enable-ssl would mean that you want a
warning if OpenSSL isn't there.

hi, attached is the icons patch i mentioned a few days ago. I created it with diff -urN
as it was the only combo i could get to work (and it is the one recomended in the linux
kernel docs). it seems to patch in well, no compile errors or anything. About "how to install
images"... well, as dillo is using the xpm file format -- which is text based -- the images
are compiled into the executable itself.

1. Broken

Sorry for the inconvenience.

I've completed a few revisions to the HTTPS for Dillo. The latest version of
the patch can be obtained from 

http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze2mqqv/dillo-ssl-cookies.2002-01-14.diff

Changes since the initial patch include:

1. When Dillo is configured to use proxies, all HTTPS requests are sent to
the proxy server via HTTP.

2. Changed uint32_t to guint32. This change let me compile on a 
Cygnus/XFree86 machine.

3. Add 'libcrypto' to the configuration script.

The diffs were generated against the current CVS (as of this writing). They
may not apply cleanly against 0.6.3. I've also integrated Jorgen Viksell's
cookie patch.

To apply the patch, download it to the root of the Dillo source tree and...

$ patch -p1 -i dillo-ssl-cookies.2002-01-14.diff
$ autoconf
$ ./configure --enable-ssl
$ make

Be sure 'gtk.m4' is in your /usr/share/aclocal directory. On many systems,
in must be symlinked from /usr/local/share/aclocal.

Apologies about the need for autoconf, but shipping diffs for 'configure'
seemed counterproductive. Distribution tarballs should not require autoconf.

Re: [Dillo-dev]image scaling?

From: Sebastian Geerken <sgeerken@st...> - 2002-01-14 16:06

Hi!

On Wed, Dec 12, I wrote:
> Since there are some other problems with images, I've thought of
> encapsulating the representation of images into a new type, which
> provides functions for:
> [...]

I've read the code for image decoding and caching, and looked how to
realize this idea in the current code. The following targets more on
simple integration, changes in the current code are minimal.

1. Instead of a guchar array, a new data type, DilloImageBuffer,
should be used (DICacheEntry::ImageBuffer and DwImage::buffer). Any
access is done by function calls: Copying the lines (in
a_Image_write) is done by a_Image_buffer_copy_line etc. The call to
Image_line becomes obsolete, since DilloImageBuffer will deal with
different types: indexed, RGB, gray, RGBA, gray-alpha(?). This may
be useful for a more efficient implementation of DilloImageBuffer.

2. The modules Png, JPeg, Gif, Image and DICache deal with the
original image size (read by the decoders), while DwImage gets the
"viewed" size (original size, multiplied by the global image
scaling factor) from DilloImageBuffer.

3. For DwImage, there are further methods, which replace the current
direct access. Note to worth:

- Shared buffers are shared, reference counters are used. Copying
rows will automatically also affect the related scaled buffers.

- There are two methods for drawing: one called after expose events
(Dw_image_draw), and another called by a_Dw_image_draw_row. The
exact rules, how the buffer is scaled (this can e.g. differ by a
pixel or so), is hidden in DilloImageBuffer.

- As noted above, all DwImage code is based on the viewed size.

4. The global image scaling factor is used in two places: The HTML
parser must apply it on the WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes of the
<IMG> tag, and DilloImageBuffer must use it to scale the inherent
size of an image. There are two modes, between the user can switch
by a dillorc option:

(i) The original image data is preserved, and an additional scaled
buffer is created:

+-------+ +------------------+ additional
| Image | -- copy --> | DilloImageBuffer | --> scaled
+-------+ rows | (original size) | buffers
+------------------+
| ^
| |
scale requests
each row for scaled
| buffers
| |
v |
+------------------+
| DilloImageBuffer |
| (viewed size) |
+------------------+
^
|
+---------+
| DwImage |
+---------+

(ii) The original data gets lost just after scaling:

+-------+ +------------------+
| Image | -- copy --> | DilloImageBuffer | --> scaled
+-------+ rows | (viewed size) | buffers
+------------------+
^
|
+---------+
| DwImage |
+---------+

(ii) uses generally less memory, while in some cases leads to a
lower rendering quality, as in this example:

"foo.png" has a size of 100x100 pixels, the image scaling factor is
50%, and the following HTML sniplet is rendered:

<img src="foo.png">
<img src="foo.png" width=200 height=200>

The first image is displayed at a size of 50x50, the second at
100x100. (i) will, for the second, use the original buffer, but
(ii) will enlarge the buffer, which was scaled down before, so
resulting in a "pixelized" image.

5. Any implementation of DilloImageBuffer will handle transparency
independent of the background, i.e. the background colour will not
be used anymore. The first implementation may be based on GdkRGB
and (when needed) dithered clipping bitmaps. Better implementations
may then developed in the future.

6. Background images: The modules Image and DICache do no longer
access the DwImage directly, all calls are replaced by and
Interface, which is then implemented by DwImage and an appropriate
structure for background images (part of DwStyle). The interface is
in C realized by a struct of function pointers, and a generic
pointer on DwImage etc. (details will follow).

Perhaps someone, who knows the image code better, finds a bug, or also
a better solution. Otherwise, I'll probably soon start to implement
these ideas.

Sebastian 



[Dillo-dev]Thanks!

From: Peter Graf <p.graf@it...> - 2002-01-14 10:45

Hi folks,

I won't be able to contribute development work. I' just like to say a big
thanks for Dillo!!! And for the way you implement it!

As a user of an "excotic" platform (Motorola 68040/68060 based), I very
much appreciate that Dillo is purely written in C, and its small size and
high efficieny! Great that libs like GNOME are not required.

Of course I am hoping for new features, but I'd also like to state from a
users point of view that Dillo is already useful right now!

Great work! Please continue the development! Thanks a lot!

[Dillo-dev]Dillo-m17n patch2

Hi, all.

Thanks to <ksr@lp.nm.fujitsu.co.jp>'s contribution to m17n patch. It
worked well with a little modification, and I intergrated some patches
into this tarball, as https protocol, cookies, and rendering Traditional
Chinese (Taiwan). I put it here:

http://ccns.ncku.edu.tw/~jimchyun/dillo/dillo-0.63-m17n.tgz

Also, I modified a configuration tool in Tk, called dillocfg. It can
be accessed in config/dillocfg after decompression. You can see the screen-
shot as following link:

http://ccns.ncku.edu.tw/~jimchyun/dillo/snapshot/

i am sorry for this page is in Traditional Chinese encoding, but some-
how it proves that Dillo could support m17n very well indeed.

Thank you very much for all your hard work, it is deeply appreciated.

Sincerely,
Jim Huang.

Hi all!

The latest cookies patch may be found at this location:
http://w1.211.telia.com/~u21114235/patch-cookies-8jan

The only real change is that I removed a security check that made some

Removing that particular check and applying the patch on top of
Jonathan Springers SSL patch actually enabled Dillo to log in to
Hotmail. :-)

actually the bsd license is less restrictive than the gpl license :)

gpl:
use our source, modify our source ... BUT : 
distribute source if you distribute binaries
bsd (without advertising clause):
use our source, modify our source, release in any form
you want

microsoft for example used a bsd licensed tcp/ip stack in win nt !
some of the tcp/ip in os2 warp were also bsd licensed if i'm not

the problem is actually with the GPL (as you are linking against

Re: [Dillo-dev]HTTPS/OpenSSL in Dillo

greetings;

i wanted to mention that this patch consistently works on *both* my
redhat-7.0 box at work *and* my FreeBSD-4.4-RELEASE box at home.

this makes me very happy.

the previously proffered patch built ok after some fiddling, but it never
actually worked.

the one point i would make your patch is that the call to autoconf is
probably a significant roadmap to wide adoption.

whatever version of autoconf was used at your home is not the
same one as is available on my RH7.0 or my FreeBSD box, because i had to
do a ton of stuff by hand to get it to compile.

i assume that the problem would be eliminated if this patch was committed
to the src tree and the 'conf bits' where done as part of the rest of the
release generation process.

great patch. tnx for taking the time to provide it! i hope this https
support gets included in the next release

You create a patch by using diff on the original source and your modified
source:

$ tar -xzf dillo.tar.gz
$ mv dillo dillo-orig
$ tar -xzf dillo.tar.gz
...modify...
...remove editors backup files...
$ cd dillo
$ make dist-clean
$ cd ..
$ diff -Burbn dillo-orig dillo >dillo-icons-patch

The dist-clean is to make sure generated files don't get into the diff,
while your new icon files do. If you had no new files, you could just use

$ diff -Burb dillo-orig dillo | grep -v '^Only in' >dillo-icons-patch

If it's not not overly long, you can post it here as an attachment,
otherwise post a link to it.

What do you do for installation of the images? I've never quite figured
out where to put such.

[Dillo-dev]New patch-o-matic site coming up

From: lrclause+<dillo@cs...> - 2002-01-07 23:50

With the haru.wom.ru patch-o-matic site being down, I decided to finally do
what I've wanted to do and make my own patch-o-matic. I've hacked up some
code to have it keep better track of what works, and it's just about
ready. Since I won't have web-based submission for a while (until I see
how the base stuff runs), I'd like everybody who's submitted patches to
send me a copy, preferably with a note of when (what Dillo version) it was
made and what it does. To avoid flooding the list with old patches, I've
set the Reply-To: to me (hopefully the list software doesn't kill it).

Happy hacking,
-Lars

Hi,

Here is an email that was sent to me. I am forwarding it to the list
because it talks about Dillo, rather than just my Japanese support patch.

Regards,

Bob Thomson.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Rough translation:

How do you do, my name is Imamichi.
I found Dillo's record at freshmeat, and
eventually I found the Japanese patch with google.
I usually use Mozilla, but Dillo's lightness was exciting.
Keep up the good work please!

[Dillo-dev]HTTPS/OpenSSL in Dillo

From: Jonathan Springer <jonathan.springer@ve...> - 2002-01-06 18:37

Attachments: dillo-ssl.tar.gz      

When I couldn't use Dillo to log on to SourceForge, I knew something had to be done about HTTPS support. Attached is the result of a few days work on extending the interface. Originally, I thought I'd just have to replicate HTTP.c and use the FD's from IO.c. Wrong! OpenSSL's libssl has these wonderful things called BIOs, except they don't behave like FDs and you can't count on anyone who doesn't have OpenSSL having them. DBIO.c in the patch replicates IO.c functionality for BIOs.

Aargh. To apply the patch, download the attached tarball into your dillo root directory and:

$ tar zfx dillo-ssl.tar.gz
$ patch -p0 -i dillo.diff
$ autoconf
$ ./configure --enable-ssl # and your other prefs
$ ./src/dillo https://so....net # test case

Note that you'll need OpenSSL installed for this to work at all.

Also, this is technically in violation of the GPL until Jorge OKs it. OpenSSL's license is BSD freeware, which is ever so slightly more restrictive than GPL. DBIO.c and https.c both require disclaimer from Jorge and I as copyright holders that it's OK to link them against libssl.

Feel free to contact me with bugs or concerns. I've just started putting this through its paces.

i think that your understanding is correct. i think that CPPFLAGS gets
misused for c++ stuff so much that i have misunderstood it's use for quite
some time!

then the fix would be to assign -ILIBJPEG_INCDIR to CPPFLAGS instead of
CFLAGS and then the problem would be fixed

Well, it's just that CPPFLAGS are the flags given to the C PreProcessor (the
'cpp' command)... So all -I directives should be in CPPFLAGS.

CFLAGS are the parameter given to the C compiler.

And CXXFLAGS are the one for the C++ compiler.

At least this is my understanding of all this :-)

Found the problem! But why is CPPFLAGS used in a C only project?Re: [Dillo-dev]0.6.3 configure and jpeg headers

From: John Utz <john@ut...> - 2002-01-04 19:55

As i indicated i would, i poked around in the configure script on my ride
home on the bus yesterday afternoon.

I will describe the misconfiguration in a moment, but i think the question
i ask in the header is a fundamental one, so we should tackle that first.

dillo is written in C, not C++, so there is no reason that i can
comprehend for the CPPFLAGS env variable to *ever*be used in configuring
or compiling this project.

this is a strong statement, and there may be things that i dont understand
that somebody else could point out that makes CPPFLAGS appropriate
(ie something broken in some compiler somewhere that requires the use of
CPPFLAGS to compile C code).

absent any compelling reason to use it, I feel that any CPP stuff should
be removed from the configure.

so, why is configure --with-jpeg-include=/usr/local/include failing to
help gcc find my jpeg headers?

because the configure correctly sets CFLAGS:
LIBJPEG_INCDIR=$withval
if test -n "$LIBJPEG_INCDIR"; then
CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -I$LIBJPEG_INCDIR"

but it uses the cpp compile command to build conftest for jpeg includes!

for ac_header in jpeglib.h jconfig.h jerror.h jmorecfg.h
do
ac_ac_Header=`echo "ac_cv_header_$ac_header" | $ac_tr_sh`
echo "$as_me:2656: checking for $ac_header" >&5
echo $ECHO_N "checking for $ac_header... $ECHO_C" >&6
if eval "test \"\${$ac_ac_Header+set}\" = set"; then
echo $ECHO_N "(cached) $ECHO_C" >&6
else
cat >conftest.$ac_ext <<_ACEOF
#line 2662 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
#include <$ac_header>
_ACEOF
if { (eval echo "$as_me:2666: \"$ac_cpp conftest.$ac_ext\"") >&5
(eval $ac_cpp conftest.$ac_ext) 2>conftest.er1


$ac_cpp should be $ac_c !!!

i'll go file a bug now

[Dillo-dev]0.6.3 configure and jpeg headers

From: John Utz <john@ut...> - 2002-01-03 20:00

hi;

IIRC, the issue with configure not finding jpeg and png ligs and headers
was supposed to be fixed in 0.6.3.

that doesnt seem to be completely true for me. it finds png headers and
libs ok, and it finds jpeg *libs* ok, but it cant seem to find the jpeg
headers.

the JPEGLIB_INC variable is getting set correctly to /usr/local/include
when i specify --with-jpeg-inc, but the configure process reports no no no
for all of the headers.

i'll will hopefully find out a more specific problem when i poke more
echo's into configure this afternoon

[Dillo-dev]toolbar images

From: ralphtheraccoon <ralphtheraccoon@uk...> - 2002-01-02 16:38

Hi, and happy new year!

I've just started hacking on dillo... I'm not all that good yet, but I've
seporated out the images in src/pixmaps.h into .xpm files in a new
src/images folder, so as to make it easier for artists to edit them
(if needed), and so that editing via gimp or other non-text editors
is possible. I've also added in using of gnome-type icons (such as
ROX-filer, gmc, and galeon use) so dillo is more consistant with the
look of other gnome/gtk apps. I'm still kinda new to this, so how should
I create a multi-file patch, and where should I put it?

[Dillo-dev]Forms & enter

From: Lars Clausen <lrclause@cs...> - 2002-01-02 13:51

First off, happy new year to everybody! May Dillo make as much progress in
the new year as in the last.

I've been wondering about the design decision to make forms only submit on
Enter when there is no Submit button. It is obviously not becuase it would
be hard to code (just pick the first submit button). The specs don't
(AFAICS) say anything for or against it. It's certainly very practical to
have Enter submit input text. Why has it been explicitly coded so that it
only happens if there is no Submit button?
