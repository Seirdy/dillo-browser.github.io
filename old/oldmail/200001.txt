[Dillo-dev]News!

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@me...> - 2000-01-13 14:41

HI there!

Time for good news!:

* Finally, I made the arrangements to keep working full-time on Dillo
project (At least for some months). I think that will significatively help
the whole project, specially at this critical fixing-redesignning stage.

* Updated the web site

* Fixed several things inside the code (including severe memory leaks).


Currently I'm heavily changing the dicache, imgsink and Image modules
(code, algorithms and ADTs). Please focus on bug fixing, and expect big
changes in the next release!

I'll try to devote all my time to this task; please excuse me if I 
procrastinate other subjects...

Nice!
Did you just run a script to change them?
(please send it to me)

Of course.

Some time ago, Daniel (Roberts) posted a very similar report to gzilla
mailing list (he worked with 'leaky' or similar), the fact that matters is
that Dillo doesn't deallocate the memory it uses before exiting; it leaves
all the cleanning work to the OS.
Specially significative is the DIC (decompressed image cache), wich I'm
extensively working now; It allocates memory for every single image Dillo
loads (uncompressed allocation).
There're also other resources (I remember five lists of allocated stuff)
that don't get deallocated when finishing...

I think it would be very interesting to write the deallocating functions
(as a_Dicache_free_all for instance), call them before exiting and
make a review of what happens then.

Personally, I've worked enough those modules, up to be deeply convinced,
that such a test is required. I can even try to write some of those
deallocating functions quickly.

Actually, I've worked the code a lot, and would like to standarize it to
g_malloc and friends (as you did), integrate your latest patch, write
the deallocating functions, and make a new release to work with.

[Dillo-dev]Memory Leak

From: Luca Rota <drake@fr...> - 2000-01-06 15:35

Hi,

I'm testing Dillo and I don't like what I see. I've changed malloc in
g_malloc, free in g_free and realloc in g_realloc in all the source tree.
I've recompiled my glib with mem_profile enabled, at the end of main()
I've added g_mem_profile() just before the return.

Test:
Run Dillo and then press <CTRL-X> (to close Dillo): 
143 Kb allocated
35 Kb freed
108 Kb in use :(

Run Dillo, open http://www.polito.it, open http://www.gzilla.com (here I got
GLib-WARNING **: freeing previously freed memory :( ), open segfault.org,
<CTRL-X>:
2.8 Mb allocated
1.8 Mb freed
1 Mb in use :(

Run Dillo, open http://www.polito.it, open Dillo Home Page, open http://www.gzilla.com, 
<CTRL-X> (this time I have't got the GLib warning):
1.9 Mb
1 Mb
0.9 Mb in use 

Maybe we'd solve this bug to stabilize Dillo, too.

Ciao,
Luca

Sammy,

Sorry, it seems I'll have to include a check within the
autoconf stuff...


The PNG support requires libpng-1.0.5 or better
(available at http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/) 

... it also requires zlib-1.1.3 or better
(available http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/)

but if you're running Redhat, you'd better grab the rpms.

its libpng, and it can be downloaded from ftp.cdrom.com or
metalab.unc.edu, or just about any big ftp site. I also had to add -lz
to the makefile to link with zlib (That's probably your problem).

[Dillo-dev]New release

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ma...> - 2000-01-05 01:02

Hi!


Finally dillo-0.0.4 is finished, and ready for download. It
includes several changes, bug fixes and improvements; some things
didn't make it into the tarball due to stability concerns, but I
hope to polish them enough to add them in the next release.
Anyway you'll find plenty of changes in the Changelog.

I hope you enjoy this release.

Caveat: The background color support is not yet completed and
if you happen to browse a page with BLACK background, you'll not
see the text! -- Luca is currently working on this.


Jorge.-


Pd: James, tomorrow I'll send you a detailed answer in regard to
the progress bar code; I liked it very much and I think we're a
few touches away from a first class meter!

Of course it's a desirable feature, but I'd rather prefer we
focus on bug fixing now; I've been deeply digging the sources
these days and I'm somewhat scared on what I've found.

Please don't get me wrong, I do like those new features, what
I'm trying to do is to finish the stabilization process, and end
up with a rock-solid browser that's easy to understand and to
extend. BTW: when adding the PNG decoding routines, Geoff used a
very similar aproach to what he saw with GIF and JPG. But the
underlying mechanism was broken, so he was not able to know in
advance that it wasn't his code's fault when some images were not
rendering... I've experienced that several times before, and it's
incredibly discouraging to start trying to find were the bug is
(or whether your fault or not), in a very big code base that you
don't know, that's undocumented and sometimes misleadingly
commented...

I don't want our developers to experience that painful coding
facts, and that's why I prefer to stabilize, clean and fix what
we have now, and after that, to focus on what we'd like to add or
improve. As a matter of fact, I've found several more bugs while
working the code and I'll introduce them into the bug track ASAP.

Please don't be deceived by a pretty face, Dillo _IS_ very
BUGGED now, we haven't reached the safe extensibilty milestone
yet. You have been warned...


------

Luca:
In regard to 'text', 'link', 'vlink' and 'alink', they are
highly required now (cause bgcolor will be included in the next
release). Please make a feature-fault entry at the bug-track and
keep up the good job!


sincerely
Jorge.-


Pd: I'll try to release dillo-0.0.4 today. 



[Dillo-dev]What's about i18n (internationalization)?

From: Luca Rota <drake@fr...> - 2000-01-03 14:50

Hi,
in this days I've tried to add i18n to Dillo. I'm using gettext package.
I've added the po/ and intl/ into source tree, modified the configure.in and
added the necessary code to dillo.c and menu.c thus I've tried to translate
some menu items in Italian (it works !).

So my question is: Are we interested in i18n?

Ciao,
Luca
