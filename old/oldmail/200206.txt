Well, I think your best bet is for sites that use cookies to
keep certain "state" information. For instance, freshmeat.net and
http://www.linuxapps.com. I was able to make the 0.6.6-release
announcement on both sites with dillo (which requires login, DB
consulting and information updating using cookies and forms).

I hope some other persons at this list point you to better
examples. There was a guy sometime ago that was testing a web
calendar application, but though I wrote to him, I never got an
answer.

Well, I think a radical example would be to enable dillo with
the HTTPS patch (very unstable), and try so....net. I
haven't done that yet, and maybe it doesn't work, but if it
works --even barely--, it could be more convincing than the above
mentioned examples.

[Dillo-dev]Sad News

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2002-06-29 21:49

Hi developers,


As you have noticed since a few months, dillo project is in a
dire need for funding in order to continue its development at
full steam.

As some of you already know, I have been working full time on
it for two years and a half, at my expense. At the present time
I've completely run out of money, and the current situation
forces me to search for a regular job to pay my bills.

This is not the result of lack of planning but of two disgraces
in a row that hit me, the latest of them, being the decline of a
Chilean enterprise whom which I had a closed-by-word agreement
that was to let me work in dillo for a full year while waiting
for the funding initiative to thrive.

Currently, I'm trying to find a short term project job that
lets me save some money, with a view to resume my work with dillo
thereafter. God knows that's not the fate I hoped for the project
I've devoted my best efforts to. So, if there's someone on this
list studying whether dillo could suit their needs, and wants to
hire me for a short working/consulting period, they'll have the
highest priority.

The irony in all this is that dillo project is in a point where
it can boost into a new level. There're plenty of ideas and most
of them have working prototypes: encryption (https), port to
GTK2, support for different languages, interoperation, embedding
dillo in a GTK+ application (a sylpheed branch does that), IPv6,
CSS, serving as front end for embedded apps., etc.

I know all the code inside dillo, and I know how close all
those goals are. They need just a few months of full time work to
flourish.

Well, I'll try to keep the pace of patch reviewing and
integration, but certainly, my development contributions will
shrink as the new job starts.



Best regards
Jorge.-

It's should work and is certainly better than the current situation.
So in my opinion, that kind of fix should be committed.

If someone figures out better approach it can be tought about later.

In this case, multiple <br>'s would not be rendered properly. A
solution may be to examine if this is the first <br> in series (by
looking if there are DW_CONTENT_BREAK's before), but for my taste,
this is somehow too hackish. (Other opinions?)

There are anyway problems with spaces, e.g. dillo does not render
something like

Some text with an <u> underliner </ul> word.

AFAIK, the spaces after <ul> and before </ul> should be ignored, as
they have to in after <table> and <tr>, etc. This should IMO solved
generally in the HTML parser.

[Dillo-dev]BR taking extra space and problem with spaces in table

From: Pekka Lampila <medar@ka...> - 2002-06-25 05:57

Attachments: extraspace.diff      

Hi,

Take a look at: http://kirjasto.org/medar/dillo/extraspace.html

The two green squares and the red "Hi-box" shouldn't have space between
them. This is solved by dw_page.c part of attached diff, setting
linebreak's ascent and descent to 0. I think this is right solution, but
could be wrong.

This error shows in many places, like slashdot.org for example :)

Second flaw in Dillo's rendering of my test page is that the red box
should cover the black cell beneath it entirely. It doesn't because
a space is inserted in the black cell.

The html.c part of the diff tries to deal with this simply by disabling
adding of spaces when in TABLE or TR. But this breaks some badly
formatted html that Dillo currently handles nicely. So after aplying the
diff, the "This is badly formatted HTML" part of test page is rendered
without spaces.

So I'm hoping that someone can make better fix for this problem.

[Dillo-dev]Multiple URLs from commandline

From: Johannes Hofmann <Johannes.Hofmann@gm...> - 2002-06-24 16:37

Attachments: dillo_multi_url.patch      

Hi all,

here is a very small patch, that allows dillo to accept multiple URLs
from the command line. With this patch you can do for example:

"dillo http://www.slashdot.org 

For each URL a new browser window will pop up. Don't know how others 
feel about popping up multiple windows at startup, but it's useful 
for me, especially for offline browsing.

Sometimes the CSS spec is more precise (by nature), and from my
understanding, the table has to make sure that the table cell fits
into the 100%.

The problem is that dillo currently deals with width specifications in
the way that they are only honoured if they are not smaller than the
minimal width, and for simplicity, if a table cell has a specified
width w, the table sets min = max = w, so assuming that the table cell
"needs" the 10000 pixels.

(Generally, this behaviour has two reasons, first it may sometimes be
useful to correct size specifications to make all the content visible;
second, since clipping is not possible yet -- although planned -- you
would get quite a mess of widgets drawing in other widgets'
allocations.)

I plan to redesign anything having to do with sizes, so this will
probably change.

In an other sense, dillo first handles the 10000pix and then the 100%

Well, the other browsers seem to ignore the 10000pix wide cell.
One could argue with 2 arguments :
1. first come wins : i.e. the 100% is the definite spec
2. a percent spec is much more device independent than a pixel spec.
and shouldn't the web be device independet ? So, in conflict, take
the least device dependent spec.

Just my 2 cents - w/o having checked the standard ... trusting Eric there.

[Dillo-dev]Very large table cells

From: Eric GAUDET <eric@rt...> - 2002-06-18 03:13

Hi all,

I have been browsing a couple of web sites that use tables in a strange
fashion. At first I did not pay attention ("damn broken html"), but as this
seems to be pretty common so I wanted to share it with you:

<table width="100%>
<tr>
<td width="10000">My title bar</td>
<td>Here my regular body</td>
</tr>
</table>

Most broswers seem to deal fine with that, and W3C html specs are superbly
ignoring the topic. Dillo, however, draws a 10000 pix wide page.

Here is my interpretation: explicit table cell dimensions (width attributes of
td and tr) are always bound to the explicit dimension of the element including
them (td->tr->table). However, table content drive the actual table cell
dimensions (for instance a width="10000" image would stretch the table in every
browser).

I am not sure how you guys want to handle this, but it is really painful to
read such pages.

Yes, and the cache system should probably handle the conversion so that
in html.c all the data is always UTF8?

If you get it to work, I can include it in my next patch.

Which should BTW include user editable keybindings through

OK, I gave the patch a lot of thought and reviews, but with no
clear results. :o

The funny thing is that the only one using IOWrite then, was
about:splash, and it does NOT free the buffer, so the hopes for
the fix on freeing the buffer in write operations being able to
silently cope with the "phantom" bug, seem gone now.

The other interesting fact is that I was working on a directory
(i.e. file:/ method), and it doesn't use IOWrite. The only one
that could have requested to free the buffer is http:/, which I
wasn't using.

What does all this comes down to?

Well, considering all the facts, I decided to commit a slightly
modified version of the patch (that does the same! :), so we can
give it more testing and hopefully get some debug messages to
review.

The mission: if ever dillo segfaults, try to find out how it
happened and ideally, find a way to reproduce it (don't forget to
grab the latest debug messages too!).


Good luck
Jorge.-

I fiddled around some and added basic pango support. The most apparent
problem is speed, specificly the use of PangoLayout combined with UTF8
conversion.
There is a need to change the logics of DwPage and not use one
PangoLayout for each word, but reuse it.

I'll look into it some more tomorrow.

Anyways, antialiased text is nice and fuzzy! ;-)

[Dillo-dev]Porting to GTK+-2.0

From: Pekka Lampila <medar@ka...> - 2002-06-16 12:12

Hi,

I ported Dillo to GTK+-2.0. Please test.

Diff against current CVS:
http://kirjasto.org/medar/dillo/gtk2_dillo_2002-06-16.diff.gz

Screenshot, which looks just like GTK+-1.2 version :)
http://kirjasto.org/medar/dillo/gtk2_dillo_2002-06-16.png

There are three problems that I'm aware of. Copy Link Location,
scrolling with arrow keys and accelator keys in menus are all broken.
I should hopefully be able to fix these soon.

And of course there is more bugs, that I haven't spotted.
(Please help in finding them.)

Note that this patch just tries to convert current functionality to
gtk2. There are more features in gtk2 that we can take advantage of.
Most importantly Pango.

[Dillo-dev]remote url control and testing patch part 4

From: Lee Van Dyke <VandykeL@ma...> - 2002-06-13 15:24

Here is the test script. Note that the url MUST be quoted and terminated 
with a ';' character.

You can use a zero time delay but seems to interrupt html_close() and 
leak memory.
It is fun to watch how fast the cpu can render though.
(For me anyway)

[Dillo-dev]remote url control and testing patch part 1

From: Lee Van Dyke <VandykeL@ma...> - 2002-06-13 14:54

Hi,

Here is a (1st cut) patch that allows another process to control
dillo's current url via a named pipe. The pipe writer test program,
wpipe1, reads a string, writes to the pipe and dillo responds. The
test script, rurl-cmeu99-2.sh, demonstrates how to use wpipe1.The test
script takes one parameter, a delay in seconds, which can be zero.

The other side benefit of this patch is automated testing. Now you can
apply industrial strength tests easily (and without the refresh
meta-tag). For example, the above script can be used to measure memory
leaks by running overnight, etc.

One thing I'm not sure of is how far dillo renders the current page
when a new request arrives. I have to dig deeper to verify but I
assume a new request aborts the current one?

Well, it appears to interrupt the html parser so html_close() probably
doesn't get called and does leak memory if the delay time is less than
the render time.

To use the patch create the named pipe on the target machine:
mknod /dev/dilremurl p
chmod 666 /dev/dilremurl

-----------------------------------------------------
The mail list restricts messages over 100k.
So I will break up the pieces until I find an ftp server to use.

Probably the quickest/easiest/least code method would be to use the proxy
mechanism and run a small, local caching proxy such as WWWOFFLE
(http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/wwwoffle/)

I haven't tried this though.

Full frames support, to the best of my knowledge, is on the todo list.
You could use Links 2.x (the new, graphical version:
http://freshmeat.net/redir/links/5817/url_homepage/) until Dillo adds in
frames support and still free your system of bloated Mozilla/Netscape.

Hi, dillo developers and users,

I started using dillo a few days ago with great joy. But for some reason
i need (would like) support for frames. I have setup a set of web pages
to monitor some machines an display the results graphs and cgi answers
in to a reponse frame. So i was wondering if there is a plan for this to
implement frame support. This would make mozilla and netscape disappear
from my disc. No need for them any more.

Re: [Dillo-dev]offline cache

From: no one <neverbefound@su...> - 2002-06-12 21:19

Ack, stop spreading FUD you lot :-P

Dillo has a full memory-cache system, a default dillo will cache
everything that it surfs across into memory - this will persist until that
instance of dillo is closed.

There is however, no hard-drive cache - so you'll have to leave the Dillo
executable running from when you were connected to the internet.

For instance, if you surf to http://slashdot.org, and then type the same
URL into Dillo 'X' hrs later, a full copy of the page will be pulled out
the cache...

If you want to see what's actually in the cache, 

apply this patch:
http://www.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/patches/cache-size-limit.diff
by Livio Baldini Soares

& a URL of 'about:cache' will bring up a nice listing of what's in the
cache...

I wrote quick 1-line patch to the above patch :) to make the cache list
into a load of clickable hyperlinks, but I seem to have lost it... if
you'd like a better search for it, or a x86 linux binary - mail me ;)

Just to reiterate: Dillo has a lovely efficient cache, but its entirely
memory based so you'll have to use the same executable that was running
when you were connected to the net...

Jarvist

P.S. A quicker (as in works without having to install any extra programs)
method of making a local copy of a website for demonstration purposes is
to use 'wget' such as
wget -rkl 1 http://slashdot.org

(-r: recursive
-k: locallised links
-l 1: goes 1-'click' deep
)

I think this is what Livio tried to explain. Namely, that

In the meantime try

Re: [Dillo-dev]Dillo scaling hack

thanks for that, I see there is a new version of dillo out.

I liked the scaling feature, it particularly suits our website 
http://www.peepo.com, take a look.

for some reason the images are more spreadout than in the original 
dillo, cannot fathom why this should be.

does anyone know?

the actual control seems a littl awkward, it is hard to tell if one has 
activated it or not.

I've some thoughts on this, yes. I'm of the opinion that scaling the entire
webpage is probably the wrong way to go: we've only got 240x320 pixels, after
all: If I try to fit a page designed for 800x600 by scaling it, the font
will get unreadable before the whole page width is in place. Sometimes,
actually, I want to scale fonts _up_ for low light, etc.

I've been pleased, actually, with how well a lot of pages work with just 
font scaling and the limit_text_width wrapping text to the viewport. If a
table is all text, the columns narrow down to a single viewports width, and
that works fine for the multicolumn layout sort of problems, as long as:

1. columns only contain text (images blow the column widths out)
2. columns are dimensioned with widths in pixels

In both cases, you can still read the text, it's just hard to scroll across
to the next column. Both of these are a pixel sizing issues. There are
other pixel sizing issues, as well: HRs, etc. Basically, anything that
can be sized in absolute pixels will blow away tables and screen space.

I'm trying out a hack that scales _all_ absolute sizes by half, as well as
image dimensions (for unsized images) This solves the direct view problem,
BTW.

My hack is at:

http://wallace.ece.rice.edu/dillo/

No ARM binaries to test, I'm afraid. Do you have a cross-compile setup
working for dillo? I'd love to know how you set it up.

From what I see on his website, _don't_ remove your existing dillo,
just replace the file /usr/bin/dillo with the dillo-scale-hack-0.6.5-arm
file, and either rename it to 'dillo', or make a symlink named 'dillo'
pointing to it. That way, you keep your menu entries, config file, etc.,
that come in the ipkg.

Hi Jonathan!

First of all read dillo/doc/Cache.txt, particularly the section
entitled "Cache Philosophy". I personally feel that Dillo will start
to become bloated if it tried to do too many jobs at once. Plus you
can bet that a cache server which was conceived to do that function
will do a better job than Dillo, which was conceived to be a browser. 

I'm not sure if Squid allows you to cache and browse offline, but
I'm sure wwwoffle[1] can. I used to use it when I had a very (_very_)
bad dial-up connection. I know that there are other packages which
also cache for offline browsing, but as far as I know, wwwoffle is the
most famous/used.

[Dillo-dev]Dillo scaling hack

From: Pigeon <pigeon@pi...> - 2002-06-12 11:40

Dear all,

After a few months I finally got time to redo this dillo scaling hack.

Details at http://pigeond.net/dillo/

Right now the hack is pretty much a "hack".

Basically the scaling is done in the image and the font. I wanted to put the scaling in the DwStyles but due the way dillo works, it wasn't quite appropriate. So right now, the scaling is done a bit everywhere when needed.

Also I'd like make the scale work for more widgets and stuffs. For instance, table right now is not scaled yet, and viewing standalone images will not be scaled yet. Stuffs like that.

I think scaling for a web browser is pretty useful and I'm wondering if anyone got any suggestions for more proper hack for this feature...

Thanks.

I'm giving a deep review to the problem, and it seems [2] may
be the fix to the problems I had.

Quoting myself:

I'm a bit hesitant with this subject. This is the story: I've
been working on presentation material for the site, and testing
its rendering with dillo; that is, small html files that are
re-created by a script very often, and then reloaded into dillo.
The sad news is that I've caught this problem twice:

Unfortunately not. All I know is I had those problems, but my
efforts to reproduce them again have been sterile. Well, I could
start working just as I did then, but if I hit the bug, I'll have
barely more than the quoted backtrace.

I'll keep on reviewing the code trying to get to the roots.

[Dillo-dev]patch to manage submenus in bookmarks

Hi all,

I know the bookmark stuff is planned to be manage with the simple
plugins idea but meanwhile i though it could be practical to be able to
handle submenus in it. 

I dig a little bit in the bookmark of other browsers and found the xbel
format, i wonder if making xbel the native format for dillo bookmarks is
a good choice. If you think is good idea i can work on it.

You can find the patch, and more information in

I have just discovered that dillo's cookies aren't working at all with the

haven't been working for the last week or more. I'm sorry, I'm not a

wrong here at all. Whether I use the --enable-cookies or not, it makes no 
difference. I have even tried deleting my whole ~/.dillo folder (actually 
renaming), but this does not work either. Something tells me something is 
broken in the code. And yes, before anyone doubts my intelligence (cough

Hum, bad news :-/ My patch isn't responsible for this crash. What
may be happening is that my patch makes this bug a _little_ bit more
reproducible, but I've managed to hit this with _current_ CVS code.

Sometimes, I get this segfault:

#2 0x401fe70b in g_free () from /usr/lib/libglib-1.2.so.0
#3 0x08087c44 in IO_free (io=0x8126fe8) at IO.c:93
#4 0x0808803f in a_IO_ccc (Op=5, Branch=-1, Info=0x8271370, Data=0x0, ExtraData=0x0) at IO.c:339

Which is the free-during-write bug. I can "fix" this either by using
my IO patch, or simply commenting off the g_free() in IO_free() just
for the sake of testing (but yes, the latter will leak memory).

But the problem Andreas was referring to is another one. It takes me
about 15 minutes of *madly* loading and reloading pages to hit this
(it is very difficult even with or without my pathes).

I can't really get to the bottom of this issue, but all my stack
traces look very similar:

#0 0x08081b4a in a_Url_str (u=0x81519a8) at url.c:59
#1 0x080534ee in Cache_url_hash (key=0x81519a8) at cache.c:91

#10 0x401fbe10 in g_io_add_watch () from /usr/lib/libglib-1.2.so.0

And the contents of (u) in a_Url_str are just non-sense.

I believe that when this error is discovered inside Dillo's current
code, my patch will probably stop misbehaving.

Just a thought... What happens if the cache code can't

This does remind me of some issues I thought about when I had the bold
idea to implement the cache size myself ;-) ....

- What happens if the data for one page is larger than the cache size ?

- Is the cache size a strict upper limit ? Or can we exceed it until
the page is fully loaded and then clean up, or should we clean up
before a page gets loaded ? E.g. what happens when the server does not send
the page size ?

- For viewing or downloading files of the size approximatley the RAM size,
do we want to have a safty break ? Or should this be the job of the OS ?
Will dillo know when its ulimit is reached ?

Just some food for though ... maybe some tough ones ...

Cheers
Andreas

With this patch, the cache page no longer freezes. But, I do get a segfault

Yes, this is absolutely true. Let me please try to explain a little
bit better what my patch tries to do and why:

There are several ways of bypassing the cache_size limit, one of
them is that which you have described. The main issues here are a
number of restrictions which currently exists in the cache and IO
modules. For instance, downloading currently requires that the whole
file be brought to the cache. Also, all URLs which are being viewed
are required to be in Cache, so that HTML font viewing ("View page
Source") and "Save page As..." work correctly. They both "assume"
that their data is in the Cache.

But these restrictions can be dealt with later on, and when they are
resolved, cache_size limit will be a "tighter" limit than it is today.

I've done the following test: opened 5-6 windows with different
pages, then on another window used "Save Link As..." on a very big
file (for example, go to http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/,
and pick a kernel there), and watched the about:cache page. I kept
reloading it and saw that when current cache size reached the maximum,
it started trying to "clean" the cache. It then removed all images and
other pages. The only ones that remain are:

[1] Entries that have a client (that is, which are being downloaded).

[2] Entries that are RootURLs currently beeing viewed on browser
windows.

But, as soon as the file gets downloaded, it is _also_removed_ from
the cache.

I hope this helps you to understand what the patch is supposed to
do... 

best regards!

After a little testing, atleast I cannot find the reload-bug again.
However, I have found a way to easy go beyond the cache-limits of this
patch. Just use "save link as..." from popupmenu over a filelink that is
bigger than current cachesize limit.

Maybe this is not intended to be fixed by the patch, since it says "half
implemented" in web.c?

Anyway, normal browsing seems to work just fine.

[Dillo-dev][PATCH] Fixing IO_write

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@im...> - 2002-06-02 16:45

Hello again!

Thanks Hugo and Andreas for helping discover this error!

My previous patch (for limiting the size of cache), will not work
correctly because IO_write():IO.c doesn't behave correctly when it
gets a EAGAIN error (it will enter an eternal loop, making infinite
writev() calls).

I have a patch here which (seems) to fix it. There are two fixes in
it:

[1] The fix Jorge and I had made in 0.6.5-pre, which was removed. This
will make IO_write and IO_callback correctly treat EAGAIN.

[2] Remove the constraint for freeing the buffer in write operations.
This error should not appear commonly in Dillo's regular use,
because it is very rare to have a HTTP query with more than one
buffer long, and therefore the IOvec.iov_base won't be
modified. But this, in fact, can happen (resulting in a Seg
Fault). What I've done to fix this problem, is added a
`buffer_start` field to IOData_t, which is _private_. IO users
shouldn't bother to set this, I have done so in a_IO_ccc().

Jorge, do you think that [2] fixes other problems you might of had
with the EAGAIN handler? If it doesn't, can you please try to give me
some directions into reproducing your problems?

So the IO patch is at:
http://www.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/patches/fix-io-egain-and-free-write.diff

And the previously announced patch for limiting the size of cache:
http://www.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/patches/cache-size-limit.diff

I would like to hear feedback with respect to his IO patch too. 

best regards!

I tested that as well - but works for me. I set the size to 100k or so.

Yes, I think I overloaded it too quickly with this 4KB limit, because
everything just froze after having visited a few pages and hitting
reload in about:cache. However now that I've tested it a bit more it
seems to function well, apart from this reload thing.

Yes, this was an error of mine, I loaded dillo with a bunch of graphics
intensive sites, a couple of windows open. It probably should take some
memory in such situations. :-)

Well, this part is hard, I cannot go to more than a few pages, before
the about:cache reload-bug hits me. So I cannot really verify that it
keeps it within the limits, however it doesn't impact stability as far
as I can tell.

This one I can verify, it works as you describe it. It lists the urls of
the browser windows, and size is very small. Also in this mode I cannot
reproduce the reload-bug, which probably is correct, since it would
require _many_ open windows at the same time to get to 4kb size of
about:cache when it is only displaying toplevel urls.

You have to hit reload, or else you'll get a cached version of
about:cache, that's why it doesn't get updated.

> 2. I of course thought about hitting reload, and that made dillo freeze 
> with 100% cpu usage. 

Ok, this was also reported by Andreas, and I _think_ it isn't the
patch's fault. I'm pretty sure it has to do with the IO.c EAGAIN issue
during writes. Jorge and I tried to fix the problem, but he said there
were some issues with that patch (which I couldn't reproduce), so he
backed it out for the 0.6.5 release. I'll try to get on top of that
today.

Anyway the problem arises when the about:cache page is over 4KiB
long (which is the size of a buffer, at least in Linux). When it is
over 4KiB, we have to write in in "chunks" (i.e. one buffer at a
time). So everything should work ok, as long as about:cache is smaller
than 4KiB.

Humm, I'm not sure what the problem is here, but be sure to notice
the difference between Dillo's memory usage and _cache_! My patch
doesn't promise to control Dillo's memory size, only the size of
_cache_.

There are two ways to verifiy if the patch is working:

[1] Look at the about:cache and check the "Current cache size: "
field, for big cache_sizes (I think over 1MiB), it should almost
never get over the "Maximum specified size: ".

[2] Put cache_size=00 and see if the about:cache always contains
_only_ the URL which are currently beeing viewed (remember to
reload the page to updated it).


Thanks a lot for the feedback! I'll try to see if I can fix the
problems you and Andreas have seen. As soon as I do, I'll post the
patch here. 

best regards!

It seems to me that about:cache working with few entries in cache, but
freeze dillo after number exceeds ~ 35 entries.

In my case (cache_size=50000) I found cache limit working good. No speed
penalities have been observed (but how to measure?). No crashes for 3
hours.
The patch applied to clean 0.6.6.

After applying the patch to dillo i tested it out a bit and found a few
strange things:

1. Quite often the about:cache won't get updated, it says it has found
my cachesize limit from dillorc, but not much else.
2. I of course thought about hitting reload, and that made dillo freeze

3. When having browsed a bit, it seems that it won't take away anything
from the cache. I set my size to ~ 5 MB and dillo was over 18 MB

I will try a little more, a clean dillo without any other patches maybe
will work better.

[Dillo-dev][ANNOUNCEMENT] Cache Limit! :-D (and other fun cache utilities)

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@im...> - 2002-06-02 02:26

Hya folks!!! 

I'm _very_ happy to announce that I think I have (finally) a
ready-to-use patch which limits the size of cache!

Jorge, congratulations on the LinuxDevices article! I am hoping that
this patch will be welcomed by the embedded devices people, and will
help enhance the Dillo experience for them (and users of other low
systems, where memory is an issue).

Dificulties (sorry for the wait)
-----------

It has taken me a _looonngg_ time to complete this patch (seems that
my first post about this was on 20-Feb-2002, with a beta version). The
main problem was trying to keep track of which URLs are being
displayed (these entries can't be removed from cache, for various
reasons).

My first try was to keep reference counters for all entries. This
solution was very ugly (specially in the reload situation with more
than one browser window viewing the same Url.. grrr :-/). I almost had
a working solution to that, but the code started to look ugly and
complicated! After spending more than 4 or 5 weekends on this, I
finally I gave up. And then I had no more time to dedicate to Dillo
(which is bad :_(. There was a Brazilian holiday this thursday, so I
sat down and was determined to get this going.

Finally, I had an _obvious_ idea to my problem, which I would reject
at first, but as I've thought and tried a bunch of other solutions,
this actually seemed the best. All I do now is check every
browser_window's nav stack to see if this is the URL currectly viewed.
Thus I implemented Cache_browser_window_search(), with a linear search
through the browser windows (shouldn't hurt much, as it is linear on
the number of windows the user has open).

Now that I've finished this patch kind of looks trivial... ;-)

Features
--------

The following patch adds these 3 features:

[1] cache_size preference option to dillorc. The size should be
specified in _bytes_. If you want to disable caching you have to
use `00` instead of just plain `0`, or else the parser will
complain.

[2] about:cache This page should contain all the info about the
current cache, which include: number of entries,
total cache size, size specified in dillorc, all the
entries (URLs and size). It also contains a link to
about about:cache-clear.

[3] about:cache-clear This clears all cache entries which currently
don't have a client (i.e. are not in the middle
of being downloaded/processed), and are not
being displayed in any browser window. And then
shows the new cache info in the about:cache
format.

I've tried the features out, and they seem to work correctly. Be
careful with [2] and [3]. If you want to update the contents of the
page, be sure to hit _reload_! If you want to clear the cache, go to
about:cache-clear and hit reload, otherwise the cache-clear function
will not be activated.

I would like to know, which of these features are of interest?
Initially, I had set out to do only [1], and used [2] and [3] for
debugging. But now I'm thinking that this may be useful to others... 

Implementation
--------------

I basically implemented this using a LRU (least recently used)
policy. For those not familiar with Virtual Memory in operating
systems, LRU is a very common policy to choose which memory pages
should be evicted to swap. That is, LRU tries to choose a page which
has the lowest probability of being chosen again, or of being needed
in the near future.

I considered this policy to suit Dillo's cache perfectly, because in
a strict sense, it is the same problem as in the operating system's
VM. In the VM we have physical memory (RAM) as cache, fast, and the
disk as swap, slow, and in Dillo, memory also as cache, and the
network as a "slow-medium".

Does anybody see a better suited policy to use? 

Another advantage of LRU, is it's simple implementation. I used a
doubly-linked list where elements at the beginning are "recent" and
the ones at the end are "old". Whenever a page gets revisited (in VM
we call this "touched"), I simply remove the entry (with doubly-linked
list, this operation is O(1)), and add the entry to the beginning
(which is O(1) too).

When I have to remove something from the list, I simply start
removing from the end. 

Patch
-----

The patch is at:

http://www.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/patches/cache-size-limit.diff


The files which are modified are:

dillorc: Added the cache_size option are reorganized the sections. 

about.c: Added the about:cache and about:cache-clear mechanisms, and
changed About_send() to be more generic, and not just send
the splash screen.

cache.[ch]: The "bulk" of the changes. Basically added the LRU as
described above in [Implementation], and
a_Cache_list_entries, which builds a HTML from the entries
for usage in about:cache. Also added a_Cache_clear() for
usage in about:cache-clear.

prefs.[ch]: Just added the cache_size preferences.


Ok, so before sending this oficially to Jorge, I think I would like
some feedback. First, any comments about the functionalities I've
inserted, but most importantly about the stability of the code. I
would be very interested in receiving bug reports. Send replies only
to me _if_ your comments won't be of interest to other subscribers to
this list. 

best regards to all!
