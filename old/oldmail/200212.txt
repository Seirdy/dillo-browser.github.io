Since most browsers do so, and it is rather simple, and does not break

Hi there,

Don't let this pass or you'll miss the boat!

After thoughtful considerations about our site's facilities,
I've decided to move dillo project to the wearlab in Germany.

That is:
- web site
- bug track
- downloads
- CVS
- mailing lists

i.e. everything.

The good news is that everything is already set and working!

Well, except for the mailing lists. I lost control of the
current one a long long time ago when James administered it. So,
please go to the new site and SUBSCRIBE YOURSELVES into the new
mailing list (follow the links).

(You may also want to unsubscribe from the current one.)

We'll be running from there tomorrow, so please do it now and
report any troubles you may find.

I've updated several things. Most notably, the project Notes
and the HTML versions for CSS and Dpi.

The site is:

http://dillo.auriga.wearlab.de


Good luck!
Jorge.-

[Dillo-dev]Dillo website statistics

From: Eduardo Marcel Macan <macan@co...> - 2002-12-19 11:53

Hello! The folks that take care of the particular machine where dillo
was hosted just told me that the website stats are up again.

Cipsga hosts many free software sites and projects, a lot of them
projects from the CIPSGA group themselves. Many of these services=20
and sites were changing servers due to administrative issues,=20
that included the dillo website, although they tried to make this=20
change transparent it seems that some little corners were yet to=20
be rounded :D

It is (i think) completely operational now.

Thanks for the recognition!

IMHO, dillo makes a different browsing experience. It lets you
grab information so quickly, that making quick online research is
possible (you may like to read the project objectives).

Very likely.

Arvind already has a prototype patch for tabs, and we're
working on the details. We don't want to hurry it, but at least
now you know that somewhere in the world, in a certain machine
dillo has tabs!

We are trying as hard as we can.

Hello out there!

This morning I read a short note about dillo and I'am really enthusiastic

good work, thank you!

I will use it as much as possible and I hope that I will find some time to
have a look inside it. The most important thing I'am missing are more
keyboard shortcuts. But even without this feature: I like it very much.

I made a patch a while ago that uses the /etc/mailcap file to find
readers. It's not the best way to do it, for several reasons, but it kinda
works. See http://shasta.cs.uiuc.edu/~lrclause/dillo-patchomatic (which is
in severe need of updating).

Eventually there should be a chooser thing that reads the mailcap file
(lazily) and remembers choices, and the actual handling should prolly be
done via DPI.

It seems like a graceful method, and quite powerful (especially when
listening on tcp). Just for fun, my brother and I wrote a shell script
that used netcat to alter our bookmarks from remote computers (I know,
you already have a solution for that, which is why I didn't bring it up
before)

By the way, what is your IP? ;)

I knew that you would. I am sure that developing a web browser makes one
familiar with the spec. I just posted the numbers for reference, and
more to prove that _I_ understood the issue. :)

I actually really like the idea of borrowing the distinction between GET
and POST from HTTP. Web developers are already familiar with it. You could
also have configuration options that restrict dpi executions, but that may
just end up being bloat.

#1 had crossed my mind. Perhaps you could specify a standard URL argument
that would tell the plugin that the request was referred from an outside
source, and that the plugin should treat it like a typical GET request and
not do anything special. Dillo would only allow those URLs to execute
plugins from outside. For example:
<a href="dpi:/mb/?submit=outside">Check your Dillo bookmarks</a>

You could also just limit dpi execution to URLs with _no_ arguments, and
specify that plugins should be written to expect that.

Anyway, I want to let you know that my brother and I test all of our web
work in Dillo. I use it regularly, even on fast computers.

The only one I've thought of was described above, and as the
solution is quite simple, I don't see any good reason to allow
links from non-dpi pages to dpi:// urls anymore.

Does anyone see another reason?

keep it stupid, simple ;)

As i have understand, there are two types of dpi plugins - 
protocol/mime handler plugins (like ftp://, https://, downloader) and 
"feature" plugins (like bookmarks plugin). The second type uses dpi:// 
protocol in url. Is there any good reason, why links from non-dpi pages 
to dpi:// pages should be allowed?

Hi, all

Our team just ported Dillo from x86/X/Gtk+ to mips/NanoX/NanoGtk,
everything went fine except scrolling, that is, when we browse a large page,
we got scrollbars, but once I drag and drop the scrollbar, the page turns
into chaos immediately. However, if I scrolled the page by using PageUP and
PageDown buttons, everything is Ok.
It looks like something goes wrong with the screen refreshment, which
is to say, if you post too many screen-updating request by scrolling the
page with scrollbar, the underlying refresh-request queue handler (NanoGDK?)
just cannot fulfil its responsibilities, while if the request is moderate,
the handler can manage it.
So, based on the observation and my conjecture, I dived into NanoGtk and
tried to resolve this problem:

1.Scrolling request is sent by gtk_scrolled_window_set_vadjustment
function
2.gtk_scrolled_window_adjustment_changed is the scrolling signal handler,
and it adds the window need to scrolling, scrolled_win, to resize queue by
calling gtk_widget_queue_resize
3.For a Container (Gtkscrolledwindow is a container)，the resizing handler
is gtk_container_clear_resize_widgets
5.BUT, this function just mark the container with GTK_PRIVATE_UNSET_FLAG
(widget, GTK_RESIZE_NEEDED); and do nothing more!

I was lost!!

So, I came up with the second solution: Change the
Adjustment->step_increment to Adjustment->page_increment, but it seems
doesn't work also!

Who can help me!

I've only received a couple of tiny comments that kept me

I know it's not easy to grasp and certainly studying it

I recognize that when designing it, I thought that having the
dpis running locally would cut "in gross" all of those problems.

After reading your email, I kept thinking about it, and two
ideas remained:

1.- Only allow a dpi url from dpi-generated pages.
2.- Add a dpi command that asks the dpi-server for a key, and
then use it to acknowledge permissions.

The first is the easiest to implement, it just requires a check
before allowing the dpi command to be issued. Is not even
necessary to modify the protocol! (and in the event of a user
longing to make a custom page, accessed as file, that uses dpi
url references, it may then be served from an elementary dpi
program).

The second option is more cumbersome, and requires two actions,
the key request, and including it in the dpi tag.

HTH.

Cheers
Jorge.-
