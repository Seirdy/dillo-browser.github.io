[Dillo-dev]Dw details

From: Sebastian Geerken <S.Geerken@pi...> - 2000-10-31 15:04

Hi!

Some details on my Dw design. Implementation is far enough to make be
beleive that this design should work quite well. In detail:

- DwWidget: set_width and set_height are currently not used, instead,
this feature is currently implemented otherwise. Will be changed
next.
The implementation of a_widget_queue_resize is currently very simple
and inefficient, but works; changes should not effect the other
code.

- DwContainer: There won't be much implementation, anyway.

- Interaction between Gtk and Dw: GtkLayout does a good job ;-).
Embedding of Gtk+ widgets by DwEmbedGtk works mainly. (BTW, focus
works very nice now.)

DwWidget
--------

My goal for the new design was mainly to make dillo's widgets more
similar to Gtk+ widgets.

struct _DwWidget
{
GtkObject object;

/* some more members, will change */
};


struct _DwWidgetClass
{
GtkObjectClass parent_class;

void (*size_request) (DwWidget *widget,
DwRequisition *requisition);
void (*size_allocate) (DwWidget *widget,
DwAllocation *allocation);
void (*set_width) (DwWidget *widget,
guint32 width);
void (*set_height) (DwWidget *widget,
guint32 height);
void (*draw) (DwWidget *widget,
DwRectangle *area,
GdkEventExpose *);
/* further methods for events */
};

size_request and size_allocate work quite exactly as in GtkWidget. I
added two methods, set_width and set_height, which may (but need not)
have an effect on the behaviour of size_request. (Probably, set_height
will not be used anyway, but it is there for symmetry.) Most widgets
in dillo will use size_request much more often that size_allocate.

There is a function a_dw_widget_queue_resize, which a widget must call
when its desired change has changed (e.g. if a word is added to a
page). The implementation is based on the size_request and
size_allocate methods, similar to gtk_widget_queue_resize), so a
widget must not implement anything like idle functions etc. (BTW,
a_dw_widget_queue_resize as well as gtk_widget_queue_resize do work
with idle functions.)

Since DwWidget's are windowless "per se", there is no need for
distinguishing between a draw and an expose method. However, if the
draw function is called because of an expose event, the method will
receive it as third argument (otherwise NULL), in case, if the widget
is interested in further details.


DwContainer
-----------

Quite similar to GtkContainer.


Interaction between Gtk and Dw
------------------------------

The top level Dw widget is handled by a Gtk+ widget GtkDwViewport,
derived from GtkLayout. GtkDwViewport is responsible for all events
for Dw widgets, the underlying GtkLayout for events for embedded Gtk+
widgets.

There is still a widget DwEmbedGtk for embedding Gtk+ widgets into a
DwWidget. Some "events" (like destroy or size_request) of those
widgets have to be caught by signals, since Gtk+ does not regard the
DwEmbedGtk as the parent of the Gtk+ widget.

(I first tried another approach, without GtkLayout, which made the
design simpler, but had severe problems with the Gtk+ widgets. So I
decided to use GtkLayout, which does a good job for this.)

From: Sean 'Shaleh' Perry <shaleh@vi...> - 2000-10-30 00:36

During some recent plane trips I have mostly finished my work on dillo and
rendering of font modifying tags. font tab itself is supported, it does not
yet support the face attribute. The sub and super tags need attention, they
are the only major things not working yet.

I intend to add a flag to dillo's configuration to ignore all font modifying
tags in the html, or only specific ones. I have even pondered saying it is ok
if font color= is set, but not font face=. Jorge, I know how much you hate not
being able to control what html authors do and I would like to give our users a
rich set of control over this. Personally, I like to see pages the way the
author intended, but I know not everyone does. Comments on implementation of
user prefs welcome. Need just a little cleanup of the code and I can submit a
patch.

Jorge, would you like for this to happen after Sebastian's Dw changes?

Sorry for not being very talkative lately, this is the first time this machine
has been on in a week. 



[Dillo-dev]Dw progress

From: Sebastian Geerken <S.Geerken@pi...> - 2000-10-28 10:43

Hi!

Another good news: Dw is working quite nice already. Embedding Gtk+
widgets is now (nearly) perfect, there are no expose problems anymore,
even resize queueing of Gtk+ widgets are recognized. After making
some changes and fixing some bugs, I'll soon start re-intigreating it
into dillo.

A note to bug #86: tabbing between widgets works automatically (done
by the base class GtkLayout or somewhere else), but the toplevel Gtk+
widget (GtkDwViewport) isn't focussable yet, so e.g. the arrow keys
don't work. Making GtkDwViewport focussable will cause some other
problems, since you may not focus children of focussable containers by
pressing the tab key (but you may by clicking on them). I'll work on
it (and make an entry in the bug tracking engine).

Images: I'll first deactivate images, and then take a look at Jorge's
changes.

[Dillo-dev]Dillo-plugins first release

From: Eric GAUDET <egaudet@in...> - 2000-10-27 16:07

Hi guys,
As I promised, I just made available all the Dillo-plugins stuff I've
been working on at:
http://www.rti-zone.org/dillo/

Feel free to send me any comments about this. 
It's stable and almost complete, so you can try and do your own
Dillo-plugins right now.

I'm still working on the patch, and I'll finish it hopefully soon
enough to be reviewed by Jorge and integrated in Dillo v0.3.

A usable Bookmarks Dillo-plugin will be available soon too, but its
developement will be disconnected of Dillo. (I'm not forking Dillo !
The purpose of plugins is to be external programs). 
The internal bookmarks menu won't be removed until Jorge decides so.

Ciao

[Dillo-dev]Progress

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2000-10-27 12:40

Hi!

A few days ago I finally devised a way to simplify the complex
alternative design; it was a major task with lots of changes that
I hope to document in the future.

The good news is that I have a running prototype of dillo-0.3.0
with it!

The prototype runs very good and only requires some polishing
before being adopted as the basis for our new release. 

In brief:

- The imgsink stuff was completely removed.
- The dicache was rewritten from scratch and integrated
into the normal cache.
- A single client queue is being used for both caches.
- The file descriptors were replaced by cache keys that serve
as connection handlers.
- The image data structure and related sources got changed.
- Every decoder (png, gif, jpeg) was adapted to the new
scheme.


The current prototype already solves the file caching problem
(and the severe memory leaks related). Now, I'll try to fix BUGs
using the tools that this new design provide. When I finish that,
it will be time to move the patch queue... But before I start
patching, I'll upload the prototype to the CVS server so it can
be tested.

I only hope this design succeeds to provide what we need...


Jorge.-

More precisely on attributes :
- NORESIZE should be used to allow the browser window to be
resized without the DwPage renegotiation its dimensions. (only useful
with sizes in %)
- SCROLLING should always be auto : there's no point to deny scrolling
in such a frame implementation.
- FRAMEBORDER, MARGINWIDTH, MARGINHEIGHT : ignored. I agree there will
be a problem here with complex pages using frames for showing fancy
displays, mostly for java applets and video streaming (none of which we
plan to support anytime soon). Those pages should be built with tables
anyway, and I don't care if we can't render "correctly" poorly designed
pages.

This multi-window implementation for frames is allowed by HTML4 specs :
(quoted from W3C site)
"16.1 Introduction to frames
HTML frames allow authors to present documents in multiple views,
which may be independent windows or subwindows. Multiple views offer
designers a way to keep certain information visible, while other views
are scrolled or replaced."

The "subwindows" is the way most browsers render frames, but not the
only one ;-)

PS: I didn't came with this idea to make frames implementation simpler,
but because I think this could be convenient for users.

While we could probably intercept resizing messages, I'm not sure this
would be a good idea. I want to keep control over sites designed for
large screens (I "only" have a 800x600 laptop). I don't see where in
html concepts the user is denied to customised his browser's behavior.

That's the current design "to-be" with Sebastian's new Dw widgets.

For bookmarking, we can bookmark only the frameset's URL. For
back/forward button, I don't see any problem : each browser window
already has its own history.

Plugins plan do handle all this (both protocols and languages).
However, we'll need a final rendering language, and IMHO html is not
worth than any other, and likely better designed than anything we can
design for scratch for our own use.
And plugins have a drawback, which was already addressed (in
Dillo-plugins protocol, to be plublished soon) about make a http plugin:
"While it is possible to override "http:", this unlikely to be a good
idea : doing that will cause Dillo to fork a Dillo-plugin for each http
request. While Dillo's main purpose is being an http client, it would
be much better to patch Dillo's http layer (instead of doing a
Dillo-plugin for that) if you want to modify/fix/enhance Dillo's http
behavior."

Same for html : Dillo was designed for fast html rendering, we should
keep html inside Dillo as THE low-level language for pages rendering.

It's cooking, be patient.

More on Dillo-plugins by friday. (protocol and design draft
documentation, patch, sample plugin and usable bookmark plugin)

As I think about this, this sounds like a neat
approach for re-sizable frames. But bear in mind that
not all frames are re-sizable. We'll need to handle
both re-sizable AND non-re-sizable frames, IMHO.

Actually, would it not be easier if we simply embedded
the DwPages within some master widget that contained
the master URL and the master frameset?

Also, another problem will surface in the course of
this: How on earth do we plan to handle bookmarking,
and back/forward buttons for frames? Last time I
checked, the W3C HTML specs generally seemed to admit
that this was a very messy situation in HTML. In
Netscape, they had a HECK of a time with this. 
Bookmarking was impossible, and back/forward had to be
given an ugly hack to handle frames, originally.

In this course of thought, yet another thought has
occured to me: With so many different
languages/protocols (http, ftp, html, xml, xslt, css,
JavaScript, etc.), why not make Dillo more generic and
modular by breaking the HTML support out into a
plugin?

Speaking of which, BTW, whatever became of the FTP plugin?

[Dillo-dev]Wild idea : frames

From: Eric GAUDET <egaudet@in...> - 2000-10-24 01:23

The list is so sleepy, let me share with you an idea I had for
framesets rendering : (not inline frame, not tables)
Don't render frames embeding DwPages in DwPages, but create an actual
browser page for each frame of the frameset, with the correct width and
height. The user can then place the frames as he wants without being
bugged with having to read a page in a tiny window.
To make that working, we'll have to add in DwPage a target attribute :
I already did that in my href page. We'll also need to add an
identifier for the frameset (say a hash of the url ?), in case the same
target names are used in different framesets. That doesn't seem pose any
problem.
We can also render the frameset window showing a scalled-down version
of the frame map : gtk containers with buttons named after the frames
titles should fo the trick. A window-manager "pager" sort of thing.

Any comment ?

If you like the idea, I'll probably give it a try when next Dillo
version comes out.

it's the expected behaviour of gethostbyname() actually (that it garbles

up it's internal data when called simultaneously in threads). i think
the thing here is that glibc might automatically use a multithread
capable
gethostbyname (which isn't one of the *_r functions specified by posix).

i did a little research today and found out that most unices have a
gethostbyname_r function, but apparently BSD hasn't (because the
function isn't standardized yet).

dillo runs fine when i put the max number of server channels to 1, so
i'll use that for now :)

[Dillo-dev]BSD ports

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2000-10-18 12:30

Sammy,

Kurt Lidl reported no problems using dillo with his BSD/OS
4.0.1 i386system <lidl@en...>.

Ryan Oberlin <ryan@sc...> got it running on
FreeBSD (with some changes that I haven't got).

tjs17@co... reported no problems with a a 32bit machine,
gcc 2.7.2.3 and FreeBSD 3.5 (with -pthread instead of -lpthread).

Jeremy C. Reed <reed@re...> has reported some
problems trying to run dillo on NetBSD (I'm sure he'll appreciate
any helping information).

Feel free to contact and ask them (please tell them I gave you
the addresses).

---

On the DNS scheme concerns. That's the expected behaviour: one
solving thread per request (Tested with more than a hundred
simoultaneous requests crowding 4 server channels).

It seems the problem is highly related to BSD's threads
implementation; but please note that FreeBSD 3.5 does the trick.


Hope this helps
Jorge.-

i have found what the problem is. apparently we are doing something
quite dangerous here :)

in Dns_server we call gethostbyname()

from manpage gethostbyname
These functions use static data storage; if the data is needed for future

use, it should be copied before any subsequent calls overwrite it.

but what we do is: we run Dns_Servers (several of them) in threads.
so it is quite possible that one query starts while another one is busy and
it will garble up gethostbyname's internal data (which is what's happening)

when i disable threading for dns i have no problems.

the debug output i get is for example :

a_Cache_open_url:
http://images.freshmeat.net/FreshMeat/Core/pc.gif?/index.php3,971817463
a_Cache_open_url: http://phoenix-adrunner.mycomputer.com/b/ar/freshmeat1/1
Dns_server: starting...
channel: 0
Dns_server: starting...
channel: 1
a_Cache_open_url: http://ads.freshmeat.net/egra5006en.gif?971817463

etc ... etc ..

from this point no single gethostbyname function will return !! note that we
had two
requests very fast after eachother.

[Dillo-dev]Find text (quite long sorry)

From: Allan Clark <shark@bl...> - 2000-10-17 16:10

Hi,
First of all I am having trouble with my network, I seem to be able to send
and recieve mail and that is about it, anyway that is why this is not a patch
but I have just included the text, there isn't much anyway and is all in one
function but sorry about that. The code below cleans up the findtext implemented
by Sam, it uses a pretty fast algorithm which will also work if we ever choose
to use unicode characters. You should be able to follow the algorithm fairly
easily but essentially it pre-computes a prefix function for the find string
this it does in linear time according to the length of the find string and only
depends on the search string and not the page's text, it then searches through
the text of the page which can also be done in linear time, and so it is pretty
fast. This will find text that is span over one or more lines, but there is one
slight known problem, this concerns moving the scroller to the correct
position, currently if the occurence of the find string is in one line then the
correct thing happens, if it spans two lines then again the correct thing
happens and the scroller is positioned as if it were only contained in the top
of the two lines, but if it spans more than two lines the scroller is placed as
if the occurence started at the second last line the the occurence spans. Other
points to note is that I have included code to enable the user to either match
the case or not, I haven't updated the rest of the code as I realised because
of my strange network problem I wouldn't be able to patch so I wanted to keep
my changes limited to one function. Also the foundAt variable gives us a little
more information than it needs but I
left it the way it is as it will make it easier to highlight the text when we
add support for that. Okay so if you're still with me, apply Sam's patch 
http://www.shark.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/patches/findtext.diff.gz
then Sebastian's patch
http://www.shark.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/patches/findtext2.diff
and then open up dw_page.c, scroll to the bottom where you will find the

It's simply a main-function of 20 lines, which creates some widgets
and then calls gtk_main. It helps me testing all functions and finding
bugs. (Furthermore, most widgets aren't ported yet, although they are
mostly simple ones, like DwBullet.) This could perhaps done also for
other modules, i.e. separating the module's code and calling all of
its functions "by hand".

Another way could be to use the existing possibilities of a server.
E.g., I already used php pages with included "<? sleep(10) ?>" to
simulate slow connections (this could also be done by a simple cgi
script), or you may create specific http headers etc.

I have written some test pages. I'll download your suite and look what

Ok, sorry. I didn't mean to break all your "rules" and cause any
confusion. I was just trying to contribute, and not "forcing" my way
into the project. I did read the home page, and read a bunch of
previous mails from the archive list, but it wasn't clear to me that
we weren't suppossed to post patches and stuff in the mailing
list. Now it's very clear, sorry.

Wow, I wasn't blaming anyone of anything, I was just stating my
opinion about how the project was organized. But since am a newcomer,
and don't nothing about it, you can just ignore my remarks ;-).

I agree with this, all patches should be reviewed. I was just
exposing an idea I had about the problem (not a total fix). I sent the
patch to show to everyone the idea I had, and wanted some feed back
about the *idea*, I know that the patch didn't solve all the problems,
and I don't expect it to be included in Dillo's next version.


I'm REALLY sorry that I caused all this commotion, I did not mean to
have a "bad start". Jorge, what should I do to "redeem" my situation?

[Dillo-dev]how i compiled under freebsd (4.1)

From: Sammy Mannaert <nstalkie@tv...> - 2000-10-16 23:38

hi,

i've succesfully compiled and tested dillo on freebsd (the platform i
run now)
in order to be able to compile, i had to do quite a few things which i
will explain
here.

i'm not sure if i took the "correct" freebsd way of doing things
however ..

first step: freebsd uses -pthread and -D_THREAD_SAFE instead of
-lpthread
and -D_REENTRANT :
type
export CFLAGS="-pthread -D_THREAD_SAFE"
or setenv CFLAGS "-pthread -D_THREAD_SAFE"
(depending on shell)

second step: freebsd uses gtk12-config instead of gtk-config :
do
ln /usr/X11R6/bin/gtk12-config /usr/X11R6/bin/gtk-config
(as root ofcourse)

third step:
do
./configure --with-gtk-prefix=/usr/X11R6
--with-gtk-exec-prefix=/usr/X11R6


now here is when a problem emerges. it seems our configure script
doesn't really
support the option to set the jpeg include lib directories ? (for the
record: freebsd
has jpeglib.h etc .. in /usr/local/include) .. anyways, i couldn't get
it to work :)
what i did:
in configure.in i outcommented following part:
if test "$jpeg_ok" = yes; then
AC_CHECK_HEADERS(jpeglib.h jconfig.h jerror.h jmorecfg.h,
jpeg_ok=yes, jpeg_ok=no)
fi

it then worked as suspected. (do we really need this part ? can't we
assume that
the jpeglib is correctly installed after we did the first test in
configure ?
checking for jpeg_destroy_decompress in -ljpeg (<- this one))


i'm not a freebsd expert by far, but i think this explenation offers
more detail than
the readme in the tarball .. (for example it doesn't add the problem of
-D_THREAD_SAFE,
if you forget it, dillo will only load the first url you go to, the
other ones will only
display "resolving DNS" or something alike in the statusbar) 



[Dillo-dev]help needed: sigsuspend with new glibc

From: Eric GAUDET <egaudet@in...> - 2000-10-16 16:49

Hi all,
I've updated my glibc to 2.1.3-5mdk a few days ago, and now I'm catching a lot
of sigsuspend in gdb (I hadn't a single one before) : on sigsuspend every
pthread_create (one for each image on a page). That's really bugging me.
What can I do to avoid this ?

Does this have anything to do with that message :
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/eric/src/dillo-0.2.4.orig/src/./dillo 
warning: Unable to find dynamic linker breakpoint function.
GDB will be unable to debug shared library initializers
and track explicitly loaded dynamic code.
dillo_dns_init: Here we go!

Can anyone help me on this ?

Sure, but Jorge already urged me *not* to bother with table testing pages, as
the first line of code for it is not even written.
But that's the next big step all right.

That would be nice. Just focus on dillo's current/likely next capabilities for
now.

Forget it, we won't need them soon.

That's not easy to publish this as a test suite : who here has an http server
running on his machine ? Who wants to patch, say boa, for faking altered http
responses to see how dillo's handling the problem, and maintain such a
malformed monster ? How helping would it be : everyone having the same
behaviour in a tight controlled environment and make sure dillo's working ok ?

What can be done, though, is one (or some) of us publish some results. 
But the most likely guy doing that is the feature-coder himself, with his own
tests. And I'm sure he won't submit a non-fully tested patch.

I'm not sure there's a point doing a test suite for this now. When dillo reach
v1.0 and everyone will be willing to add nigty feature, then we'll want to make
sure we won't break anything.

For now, I mainly want to test what I'm adding, relying on others to do the
same for what they're doing.

The bookmark thing was always alpha code. It's a quick hack nobody wants to fix
because :
1) there's a lot to do elsewhere
2) there's a bookmark as pluggin planned since day one, better, easier to fix,
external to dillo, hopefully making obsolete the current fishy code.

If you want to maintain the Html testsuite thing, help yourself. You can take
what I made and mix it with whatever you think is relevant. Or we can both
update it.

I would definitely be willing to perform the tests,
given the links Eric just posted.

Also, with Gzilla/Armadillo, I used to post Insure++
memory leak reports sometimes. I can do the same for
Dillo if it helps.

[extra deleted for brevity...]

I just took a look at it. At the moment, it does look
to me like a reasonable subset of HTML tests, given
Dillo's current status/capabilities. When
tables/frames support is complete, I am guessing that
tables/frames tests will be the next thing to be
added. :-)

BTW, Mozilla has a *HUGE* test suite, with tests
scattered all over the place. I suggest we might want
to consider using some of these tests. I'd be willing
to bring them over here and adapt them for Dillo's
use, if you'd like to add them to your testsuite. 
When the time comes, Mozilla also has XML, CSS, and
JavaScript tests as well. They are good and complete,
what's more.

I think however that we *DO* also need things like
http requests, cache behavior, and other things a
browser should do. For example, how about the
bookmark bug that someone pointed out was fixed THREE
times? A regression test on this should have helped
point this out earlier. :-) However, since I actually
probably know HTML and CSS better than I do XML or C,
I will probably be able to do these most readily.

I've already included in most of the pages I made if dillo v0.2.4's behavior is
correct or not, and sometime what it should be. I planned to update this when
next version (not cvs) will be available. 
It's an HTML-rendering testsuite only. I won't build any testsuite for cache

[Dillo-dev]Patches

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2000-10-16 11:49

Hi!

The minimal consideration I expect from newcomers, is to read
the home page before posting to this mailing list. If they don't
or even worse, they do but decide to force their ways into this
project, we have a bad start...

Rules are there for a reason, and I want to thank Eric for
pointing them out to the mailing list.


> It would be really nice if we had an updated CVS version to patch

The CVS version is the most current (official).
Developers can patch 0.2.4 (or CVS).

> if things were a little bit more organized.

Please don't blame on us the results of you not following our
rules. You could have known that in advance. As a matter of fact,
you knew I was working some of the bugs you tried to fix.

If you read the mailing list archives, you'll find an
"Activity" post (by me); there you'll find a list of things that
your patch doesn't solve, and maybe then it will become clear why
patches are reviewed before inclusion.

Finally, I'll keep my schedule exactly as described in the
"Activity" post.

---

Bug track engine:
----------------

I see one source of confussion (and a solution) here.

I'll use the word "done" to signal a CVS commited patch.
Developers, please only use comments or a percentage.

Example:

MrX@so... 70% <- The guy is making some progress

MrX@so... 100% <- The guy is finished his work and the
patch is expecting a review.

MrX@so... 100% done <- The patch was reviewed (fixed) and
commited to the CVS.


----

Regression tests:
-----------------

Some time ago Eric commited to compiling a test-suite for dillo
(we discussed several topics and its ready). I've had no time to
test it, nor to include it in official plans (due to lack of
time, --I sincerely apologize Eric).

I've read Daniel's posts on the subject and if he's willing to
perform the tests (or any one else), please contact Eric and
start working from his test-suite.

Err, it's suppossed to do that. The watch serves so one can control
when the lock was ON or OFF, not when/while all the page was
loading. I did that cause sometimes the lock would go ON and wouldn't
go off like it should (like when a page is not found or some other
error, which currently the lock system isn't implemented to work
on). So if the cursor continued to be the watch for no reason, just

Yeah, I get that too, but as Sebastian said, closing windows are not

pending requests don't have a place to go, then they get sad and crash

Looks nice. I can't really test it, because my cable modem loads pages too fast
and I can barely see the watch ;-) I wanted to see if one can scroll in a
partially loaded page, but I can tell really.
However, it seems not to wait until all images on a page are loaded, is it the

I experienced some segfaults too. I can't reproduce them each time, but it

[Dillo-dev]File baseurl resolving behaviour

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2000-10-16 05:15

Hi guys,

again browsing in Dillo I tried to do the following; I wanted to
check the contents of my /tmp directory, so I typed in:
/tmp/

on the "New Url", instead of file:/tmp/. Dillo assumed that it was a
http request and tried to resolve http://tmp/.

Im my opinion, this shouldn't happen. I think that if a user enters
an URL starting with a '/' then he wants a file not a http. What do
you guys think?

Anyway, I've already made the patch (its really small), and am
sending along with the message.

Re: [Dillo-dev]About bugs #74 and #69 (better program and watch cursor feature)

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2000-10-16 03:02

Attachments: seg_fault2.diff.gz      

Hi yall,

I've been working on my patch, to better it. First thing I wanted to
make the cursor change into a watch or something while the lock (which
I mention below) was on. To do is I started messing more with the code
and realized that the lock system which I created was starting to turn
into a headache. So what I did was, I encapsulated the system into
basically two calls (which I included into nav.c):

a_Nav_lock_acquire
a_Nav_locl_release

And except for some early BrowserWindow initilization, these are
what you should call, and never access bw->nav_lock directly (like a
private in C++). This way the code looks much better, and easier to
understand and expand.

With this done I was able to successfully implement the little
"loading watch" which I wanted (it was getting on my nerves not
knowing what Dillo was doing, if it was loading the page or not,
etc. with this watch cursor a now the lock is acquire threfore
*should* be indicating that it's loading a root-Url).

Attached is the gzipped patch, which should deprecate the previous I
sent. I don't know if this will help in the future, maybe Jorge will
sanitate all our problems with his new misterious Dw ;-). But until
then, I think this is a nice working patch. What do guys think?

bye,

Livio.

I agree. Question is, why are the patches not being
committed to CVS? I would think the thing to do it
have them checked in, after undergoing a code review. 
Then we wouldn't have this problem. Besides, if a
change is found later to cause problems, it can be
backed out. Again, some kind of automated regression
testing infrastructure would make this part easier, too.

It seems like it's extremely difficult to avoid repeating work currently

There is a function a_Interface_new_browser_window, so there should
probably also be a function a_Interface_destroy_browser_window, which
will do a bit more that destroying the widget. Merely destroying the
widget could even cause crashes (AFAIK dillo), since the still active
IO stuff could try to add text into the nonexisting page widget.

[Dillo-dev]About bugs #74 and #69

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2000-10-15 08:49

Attachments: seg_fault.diff      

Hi (again),

I know that Jorge is working on these bugs, but I *think* I've found
a good solution to the problems (actually I'm not really sure...). It
seems to me that the problem comes from a type of "concurrency"
problem within the IO and html/cache modules. The http requests in
Dillo, from what I understand, are all asynchronous, but I've seen no
concurrency controls in the modules. I think this lack of control is
generating the problem.

For example, if I press the "Achieved Goals" link in Dillo's home
page, don't wait for it to load and press the "Changelog" link (or any
other, even the "Acheived Goals" repeatelly), Dillo will request ALL
the "clicked" links pages. Up to this part everything should be ok
(actually no, but I'll get to that later), the problem comes in when
the requests arrive. Many requests start coming in and Dillo gets
"confused" and can't handle them all.

What I've done is prevented various (root) Url requests at the same
time. This is what Netscape does, when you click a link on a page, the
cursos turns into a watch and all the other links become
"un-clickable" until the new page gets loaded. I think this is a
"correct" behaviour and not a restriction to the user.

I did this in Dillo by placing a type of LOCK in the BrowserWindow
(browser.h) structure. Its a gboolean `nav_lock`. When someone tries
to load a root-url, by using the `a_Nav_push` I set the nav_lock to
TRUE. By doing this I disabled any type of user navigation. The only
two places where `nav_lock` comes FALSE again is by pressing STOP (in
the `a_Commands_stop_callback) and in the `a_Nav_expect_done`
function, because here we can assume that the root url has changed
(bw->nav_stack[nav_stack_ptr]) and therefore we can allow the user to
navigate savely again.

When I got this working I would still (very seldomly) get
seg. faults. Studying the problem I found out that if, for example,
you click on a link, then wait until it get "unlocked" (when the
`a_expect_done` is called), then press BACK before the entire page
loaded (pics and all), a few pending requests for that page are still
coming in. With that in mind, I tought of two choices:

1) Everytime the user requested for an URL, Dillo should cancel all
the pending requests for old URLs, so that the requests wouldn't
arrive later "unexpectedly".

2) Don't cancel the requests since Dillo has already made then; I
think it would be a wast of data. Instead just ignore the few pending
requests.

I chose option 2. I did this similar to what Sam Dennis did a while
ago (when he send the patch). From what I can see applying these two
ideas (the lock and Sam's patch) we have a pretty much clean fix to
the problem. Of course I could be wrong and missing the "root" of the
problem. Does anybody see any flaws in what I've described above?

This lock system, if it's conceptually correct, should fix this
bug. But what I've implemented is NOT the complete lock system, it's
just a preview on how I tought to fix this problem. If you guys like
the idea, I'll have to finish up the exception handling (so if there's
an error while downloading a page, navigation doesn't become forever
disabled, erroneously locked).

I'm sending the patch that should implement this fix, included is
Sam's patch (html_loading.diff) and the cache patch (cache_patch), so
there's no need to apply those patches, only this one. This patch
should be applyed against the CVS version.

hope this helps, bye,

[Dillo-dev]Close Window command

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2000-10-15 06:24

Hi all,

messing with Dillo, I tried to do the `Close Window` function
(Crtl-W or Menu select `File -> Close Window`), well nothing
happenned. I looked at commands.c, and all I found was the empty stub:

void a_Commands_close_callback(GtkWidget *widget, gpointer client_data)
{
}

Below it I also saw the exit_callback and in it a commentary:
/* There should be a close command that does this: */
/* gtk_widget_destroy (bw->main_window); */

So, that's exactly what I did, now close_callback looks like:

void a_Commands_close_callback(GtkWidget *widget, gpointer client_data)
{
gtk_widget_destroy(((BrowserWindow *) client_data)->main_window);
}

What gives? Am I missing something? Why wasn't this already done? I
tried it out and it's working fine. Including when your in the last
window (only one left) and when you `close` it (not `exit`), dillo
exits normally.

I guess I've probably missed some previous discussion... Just in case,
I'm sending the "patch".

You should not bother with published patches unless you want to test one (and
only one at time : it's very unlikely you can apply all without reworking most
of the diffs, which will be done by Jorge for next version)
You want to patch against v0.2.4, (or CVS version, which claims to be v0.2.5).
It's also possible you need/find handy to patch a patched version. If you don't
patch against vanilla v0.2.4, list all patches needed before yours.

Only jorge can decide if a submitted patch will be included in the official
dillo version. It's not a good thing to have a fully patched version. For us
patchers, there's only one developper version, the lastest : 0.2.4.
CVS is to be considered experimental.

The bug track system is the most up-to-date informations you'll have, because
it's automated and updated by everybody (actually I think Jorge is kind of
moderating it, but the delay is not noticably larger than one day).
Use it to report bugs you've found and things you want fixed by somebody else.
Use it to tell everybody what you are working on (to avoid duplicate efforts).

This is really helpfull! I got all the patches (ps. seems like
html_loading.diff and html_loading1.diff are the same. Anything wrong
with that?).

With all these patches I'm starting to get a little confused... I'm
trying to solve bug 74# (and others that arise due to the same
problem), I believe I've found the problem and have a "clean"and
simple fix, but I'm supposed to build it on top of what version?
0.2.4? CVS? CVS with all the patches applyed?

I'm asking cause some of these changes will affect other code we
build on top. Plus there seems to be a new Dw beeing made, and a
testbed(?).

It would be really nice if we had an updated CVS version to patch
to, or if someone (one of the olders guys with the project) released a
0.2.5 or 0.2.4-1 or something like that, with all the "pending"
patches included, cause frankly it seems too confusing and I have no
idea where to start programming so my works are all wastedøutdated.

Sorry if I seemed annoyed, but I'm not. It's just not nice to have
people's effort thrown away in vain, when they could be producing lots
if things were a little bit more organized.

By the way, is the `Bug Track System` being used? More precisely is it
valid and not outdated?

BTW, this also is reason to think about open-source
philosophy... I am not ordinarily that philosophical,
but it has occured to me that ESR said in "The
Cathedral and the Bazaar," that "given enough eyes,
all bugs are shallow."

However, seeing this bug which has regressed THREE
times now, I think, proves ESR wrong on this point. 
His approach seems rather like the classic "monkeys at
typewriters" approach to Shakespeare--that is, given
enough 1000's of monkeys at enough 1000's of
typewriters, one of them somewhere will type "to be or
not to be."

I do believe however, this proves why one needs to
think of open-source as merely the LICENSING framework
for a project, and not a specification on how the
development efforts are coordinated and managed... 
Case in point: the GCC Steering Committee does
automated regression tests. I think Dillo could
benefit from this, too.

That's why one does QA/regression tests. :-) Perhaps

first let me thank Eric for taking the time in answering me. I found
out what the problem was with my glib (I had 2 glib's installed, one
in /usr/ and the other in /usr/local, I guess they were conflicting,
since their versions didn't match). 

Messing around with Dillo I wanted to bookmark Dillo's home page
(dillo.so....net) and then Seg. Fault!

I looked at the code, and I guess I got a patch working (actually just
an tiny change, just a NULL check). Latter I found out at the Bug
Track page that this was bug #85. Hope this helps, here's the patch.

bye,

PS: I read in the mail archive that someone made a patch for the `Find
Text...' function, where can I find it? The only thing I found was
another patch to be used afterwards so the use of anchors wouldn't be
needed.

Lastest version is 0.2.4. You can patch against it. mime and url directories,
as well as the Dname.html page look like old stuff (gzilla era), you can safely
ignore them.

[Dillo-dev]Newbie questions

From: Livio Baldini Soares <livio@li...> - 2000-10-13 04:56

Hi guys,

I was looking around in Sourceforge for a new browser in constrution
(or finished), 'cause I'm goddam sick of Netscape exiting for no
reason at all. I found that Dillo was the best project and looks like
it has future. I liked the project so I've decided to try to
contribute in any way way I can. The problem is I'm still a newbie in
Linux and Unix programming, so if I'm being out of hand or something,
please let me know.

Where are the latest versions/patches? I saw somewhere on your webpage
(dillo.so....net/Dname.html) that there are MIME/ and URL/
directories undeer the src/, but when I got the 0.2.4 version, I found
no such directories.

I downloaded the cvs files by doing:

$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cv...:/cvsroot/dillo co dillo

like indicated on the Sourceforge CVS page. And then couldn't compile
it. The problem was with the `g_print()'. I don't know, but there must
be something wrong with my system (I use Debian 2.1, aka potato, and
have installed: libglib1.2(-dev) -- 1.2.7-2). I try to compile a
simple program like:

-----------------------
#include <glib.h>

int main(void){

g_print("Testing...\n");

return 0;
}
-----------------------
And compile it:
$ gcc test.c -o test -lglib -I/usr/lib/glib/include/
$ ./test
Segmentation fault

Someone knows what's going on? 

What I did to "overcome" this problem is switched to plain `printf()'
function:

$ cd src/
$ for i in `find . -name "*.c"`; do ./chg $i g_print printf; done

And THEN it compiled. I'm running it fine and enjoying it! Congrats on
the great work guys.

PS: Sorry about the stupid questions, and the long mail.

I wrote all these functions (from
Dw_gtk_scroller_adjustment_value_changed to the end) for anchors, and
exported only those which were necessary for them. If some functions
are useful for other purposes, they may be exported, too.

I think that most of the crashes are happening in the html rendering,
actually. Although I have had one or two of them inside a perfectly valid
call to realloc.

Since then I've tried to test it by searching around a nice long court
transcript and it didn't crash once. This and a number of other things makes
me begin to suspect my libc instead...

[Dillo-dev]Find text patch

From: Sam Dennis <sdennis101@ge...> - 2000-10-10 00:10

Attachments: findtext.diff.gz      

I've implemented a find text command for the first instance of the string
(it shouldn't be too difficult to extend it to finding multiple instances,
probably just starting by looking from the line after the last instance was
found).

I'm sorry about the anchor, but it seemed like the only sane way to scroll
to the line we found.

It doesn't highlight the string found in any way, partially because I don't
think that any mechanism for this is currently in place.

BrowserWindow *bw;
GtkDwScroller *scroller;
GtkDwView *view;
DwBorder *border;
DwPage *page;

scroller = GTK_DW_SCROLLER (bw->docwin);
view = GTK_DW_VIEW (dw_scroller->viewport);
border = (DwBorder*) (view->dw);
page = (DwPage*) (border->child);

I think border is sometimes NULL, so you may add some checks.

[Dillo-dev]Small idea for caching

From: Sam Dennis <sdennis101@ge...> - 2000-10-09 17:22

I've just discovered a note I made to myself a while ago about dillo's
caching system. There is currently a complex system of callbacks necessary,
but couldn't a lot of that be thrown away with a simple pipe between the
caching system (server) and the dillo widget (client)?

[Dillo-dev]Activity

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2000-10-09 17:07

Hi there!


Just as before, silence periods on the mailing list, signal
high activity on the background! (Well, my email box seldom stops
its flow).

I'm very pleased for the "parallel" working the code is getting
(Several improvement and fixing patches, design on the widget
side and design on the Networking and middle layers by my side).

Currently I have a lengthy queue of patches waiting to be
processed (from Jörgen, Eric, Agustín, Marcos, ...). And I keep
trying to solve the design issues of Networking/Middle-Layers
that result in a lot of related bugs. I think this is the highest
priority (for me to work on); Look this:

- BUGs 74, 84, 64 and 69 are related to it.
- File images being decoded every time (not fed by the dicache)
- Fine reload functionality can't be done without it.
- The problem asked by Sean MacLennan
- Sudden crashes
- Slow downloads (it may happen)
- General browser stability.
- etc.

I'll keep working on it all October; If I don't succeed, I'll
start reviewing/integrating every patch and make a new release
based on 0.2.4.

The good news is that finally I got into a design model that
handles all the necessary stuff. The bad new is that it's too
complex (and we all know that maintaining such things becomes a
nightmare). So, it will be done when I devise a way to simplify
it one or two "degrees".

Yes, I know. That's the right way to do it though. 
I mean: a_Nav_push should not crash; that's a BUG.

That is part of a_Nav_push's work. You should not worry doing
it "by hand". It seems to me that you'll have to wait until the
design concerns that eliminate "the BUG" are done.

(The only thing you need to worry about is not calling
a_Nav_push from an interrupt handler, but to generate an event
that triggers it from GTK's main loop).

Obvious? I don't think so!

The top 'dw' is set by a_Dw_gtk_scroller_set_dw (you can follow
the chain from there).

In brief:

bw->docwin is a GtkDwScroller
bw->docwin->viewport->dw is a DwBorder
bw->docwin->viewport->dw->child is a DwPage or a DwImage

so, something like this will get you going:

GtkDwScroller *scroller = bw->docwin;
DwBorder *border = scroller->viewport->dw;
DwPage *page = border->child;

Notes: you have to add type checks and things like that.
I haven't tested this but it should be very close.

Hope this helps.

Even if I do that, I still need a pointer to a DwPage, and I see no way of
getting it. There is also the issue of frames and (possibly) tables here, as
both are separate pages, how do we know which to search even if we can get
pointers to them?

You'll have to create a new external function in DwPage (a_Dwpage_findtext ?).
That way you can either register it as a callback, or call it yourself from
whatever other source (command.c ?).

This sounds like a VERY nice thing! I believe
Incremental reflow is what the Mozilla people call
this in Gecko, BTW. This should make Dillo better
than Netscape 4.x was at table rendering! Incidently,
Netscape's table rendering was VERY slow, inefficient,
and memory-hogging. It sized things dynamically
during multiple attempts, storing every attempt in
memory. This meant (if I understand them correctly)
that say, for tables of 10 columns by 10 rows, it
would store 100 attempted and failed trials in memory
before getting it right. Since Netscape never
implemented incremental layout of page sections, the
document state was split up and most of it used to
simulate a cell as a nested HTML document. This
allowed them to use the existing layout code to
simulate the layout of that cell multiple times until
the size was right. It was slow and wasteful of
memory. To make matters worse, their attempts to
optimize and streamline made the code difficult to
read and never really solved the problem of less than
optimal memory use and speed.

For details, and mistakes to avoid that Netscape made,
I find this document VERY interesting reading:

Interesting. So does this mean that you could have
say 3 distinct buttons inside each other, each
performing different actions, like so:

------------------------
| Button 1 |
| |
| |---------| |------| |
| |Button 2 | |Btn. 3| |
| | | | | |

This depends heavily on the Dw structure (in both cases, either if you
let Gtk+ (GtkWindow) do the work, or -- which I would prefer -- let it
do by GtkDwViewport).

Or:
- When jumping to an #anchor in the same page, the url should be
pushed on the navigation stack. See Nav_open_url and struct
_BrowserWindow.
- A menu of the last visited urls, like the one you get when you hold
the "Back" button pressed for a while in Netscape, or click on the
small button right on the "Back" button in MSIE.
- Implement the <link> tag, and e.g. add an menu "Related pages" or
so, with some accelerators, so the user must only press N for the next
page etc. (I hope, some authors still use this tag.)

4) Tables are 2-dimensional, while frames are only aligned in one
direction, i.e. you must nest framesets to get a grid of frames.

5) The size of a table cell is (in most cases) calculated by the
browser, the frame's size is determined by the web author.

DwPage doesn't bother about its parent widget (either at toplevel, or
in a DwTable, or, as inline frame, in a DwPage?). It will just paint
itself where the parent wants it to do, and report size changes
(incremental rendering!) to its parent. (BTW: Vice versa, DwTable will
not bother about its children, it only regards at them as DwWidget's.)
This is very nice in Gtk+: all widgets have a very special purpose, a
button is something where you can click on, but how it looks is
determined by *its child*. You can even nest buttons, which is
admittedly quite silly, but who knows. (In early versions of gnome,
the panel menu entries had submenus on the right side.) This results
sometimes in a horrible widget hierarchy, but is still efficient
enough, and much easier to extend than if you have buttons with a
label, buttons with a pixmap, buttons with a pixmap and a label below
the pixmap, buttons with a pixmap and a label right of the pixmap etc.

(gdb) print sizeof (DwPage)
$1 = 184

(I admit that it will take a bit more after initialization.)

Memory is not the problem, but perhaps time, since size negotiation
could happen to often. But currently it works very fast for normal
pages, and so I think we should look how it will work for tables, and
then eventually optimize it in detail.

[Dillo-dev]Minor view source change

View source shouldn't get the url from the location widget as that isn't
necessarily the url of the page that is shown.

right, iframes are like a single table cell embeding a separate page (URL). No
span tough. And you still can show the same structure as a complex table with
it.
It's kind of new too (HTML4 ?) : even my nestcape 4.72 can't render them.
Anyway, all suggestions I heard about table/frames handling can quite easily be
extended to iframe (once we've decided how to embed a page in a page).
Not a big deal.

Right again !

What I did for that is choose easy bugs in the bug-track engine (or some of my
own ideas) and try to make a patch, as a skill training. You'll find most of
the code clean and easy to understand. Some areas are still obscure to me
(attrs ? cache ?). Even if the patches are rejected, this is still a great way
to learn before trying hardcore table/frame coding ;-).
May I suggest :
- PNG transparency (bug #60)
- GIF animations support
- form widget jumping with tab/shift+tab (bug #86)
- X clipboard support (bug #59)
- adding "copy this link" to the popup menu
- adding "save this image" to the popup menu
- fix the status bar informations disapearing
- implement "find text"
- implement basic httpauth (see with Sean if he's not doing it already)
- implement SUP and SUB tags
- fix corrupted PNG segfault.

As you can see, there's some big code planned (table/frames, IO engine,
unified alignment), but there's also a lot of small things to do you can
choose to improve both your skills and dillo :-)

AFAIR there was a big effort to make dillo compile under libc5, and I heard
somebody tryied it on BSD with some success (a little less stable than on
linux ?).
I don't know about windos and beos, but I'm sure the folks here would welcome
any volunteer.

Ah, but what about inline frames?


All in all, it looks to me like tables/frames are THE
next big thing to concentrate on in Dillo. As I say,
I'll need to learn from the ground up on more basic
things first, however. :-) But I do want to see what
I can do.

BTW, I am also curious now about cross-platform

since it is GTK+-based, Unices would be relatively

GTK+ supports Windows, but I can see a new
networking/IO layer being needed... Same for BeOS,
since GTK+ supports BeOS, too. Mac I would think
would be even harder though.

I'm thinking of 3 reasons why table and frames are different.

1) Table cell can span on several row or colomns, frames don't.
Example :
<table>
<tr><td rowspan=2>a</td><td colspan=2>b</td></tr>
<tr><td>c</td><td>d</td></tr>
<tr><td>e</td><td>f</td><td>g</td>
</table>
should be rendered like :
+---+-------+
| | b |
| a +---+---+
| | c | d |
+---+---+---+
| e | f | g |
+---+---+---+
To make frames look like this, you'll have to do much more complicated things.

2) Frames can have sliders and be resized, tables don't.

3) Table cells embedding an htlm page is only a convenient way of
rendering tables, but there is no actual html page (eg: file) as such.
Framesets _are_ separate html (or not) pages (in the cache) that have to be
loaded.

That's why frames are not a subset of tables, and tables are not a subset of
frame.

IMHO frames and table have a very different behavior, both the way they look
and their underlying implementation. 
Perhaps we can come with a common page structure (ex DwPage ?), that would have
the ability to be both a full html page (part of a frameset) or a table cell.
I'm not sure this will be the best way : most table cells contain only an image
or a text paragraph. Building a whole html page for that will be a big waste
(think about those >1000k tables ;-).

I'd prefer to split the current DwPage in two widgets : one for the html
rendering only (say DwRenderedHtml) which would do what the current DwPage do
with lines, words ; one just like DwPage, but without what's done by
DwRender : only links, gc, attrs, anchors, ... This DwPage would of course
point to a DwRenderedHtml

For frames, we use GtkContainers with DwPages.

For tables, a new widget DwTable would contain the structure of the table and
pointers to DwRenderedHtml widgets, one for each cell.
DwTable would be a word widget, just like an image is now.

... that's it ;-)

(and we should wait for Sebastian's new Dw widgets)

Mozilla faced the same problem, both in the Motif and
the GTK+ ports. They ended up using a GTKLayout
widget instead of a GTKDrawingArea for the page layout
area, IIRC. Problem with this however, was that they
then had a constant battle to fight with the GTKLayout
widget's want to do its own layout things... So they
wrote this whole new library/widget (with the help of
Owen Tayler of GTK+ fame) set called GTKSuperWin. 
Could we perhaps use this, BTW?

How are tables that different? Netscape/Mozilla used
to render tables as complete HTML documents within a
larger one. After all, tables can also have images,
text, and everything else a complete HTML document
has.

There is also a reference and some mailing lists at http://www.gtk.org. A
good "tutorial" for using Gtk+ are the sources of Gimp, a good way of
learning how to write new widgets is reading the sources of Gtk+
itself.

Dw is not completely rewritten, since the other widgets (mainly
DwPage) will ported to the new Dw.

Gzw was written (afaik) mainly because of the size limitation for X
windows (and so Gtk+ widgets), otherwise pure Gtk+ widgets could be
used. It can embed Gtk+ widgets, but that does not work perfectly, so
there had been some discussion on eleminating Dw, but that will make
dealing with the size limitation quite complicated. (This is my
personal opinion. Jorge did not decide yet, what will be used in
future, so I tried to implement and test my ideas.)

Dw embeds Dw already now, e.g. bullets and images are Dw widgets
embedded in a DwPage. Embedding a DwPage in a DwPage is also possible,
and if they share the same html document (as in tables), the html
parser has to be extended, e.g . by a stack. I did already hack
something like that which worked halfway, it should not be too hard.

Tables and frames are quite different, the only thing they have in
common is, that they contain text, so IMO the simplest way should be
to write them as containers for pages.

Interesting. But where I can see this getting tricky
is things like tables nested within tables, or with
things like inline frames (not to mention re-sizable
frames). How will this scheme handle those things? 
For huge tables (like >1000k), won't it get a little
slow? Yes, there ARE tables >1000k. Mozilla had a
bug filed on such tables being slow to render. :-)

Okay. Well, for starters, does the UI need anything? 
I'd like to experiment with GTK+ a bit if I can... I
am trying to learn GTK+, so if anyone can give some
pointers on using it (other than the tutorial, which I
am already actively reading), I would appreciate it.

Glad to hear from you, the above is kind of the implementation I had in mind
for tables and frames, my suggestion is that we should have a page being
either a list of horizontal subpages, a list of vertical subpages or a page
as they are just now implemented with lines, and then each "leaf" page can
take care of drawing (alignment etc) by itself and all the parent pages need
to do is tell all their children to re-draw, re-size etc.
As for what you can do, well pick something you think dillo needs and just
do it (I hope I won't get into trouble for nicking nike's slogan) I think
the main thing is to get Sebastians port of dw working correctly, so if you
can help with that it would be great but it is your time so do whatever you
enjoy the most.

Note to Sebastian: would you like me to put up the sources of your dw on the
web page I'm using to do the dillo news, that way you wouldn't have to mail
it to everyone who asks? I can also update it pretty much when needed. 



[Dillo-dev]What can I do?

From: Daniel Roberts <zuperdee@ya...> - 2000-10-06 15:26

Hello all!

I am checking this out because Christopher Reid Palmer
has effectively admitted that Dillo will probably
become the real successor to Armadillo, and that
Armadillo is effectively dead, since he hasn't enough
time to dedicate to it.

Dillo, IMHO, has definitely already surpassed both of
its predecessors (Gzilla and Armadillo) in almost
every aspect. I am hoping it is well on its way to
competing with the likes of KDE's Konquerer, or maybe
even Mozilla. Lord knows I worked on Mozilla for
quite a while (and still use it for everyday browsing,
cause there ain't any real alternative for GNOME folks
like me), but I still find Mozilla to be painfully
bloated, inefficient, slow, and memory-hogging, even
after their wonderful ground-up re-write based on
Gecko. Bottom line is, I have come to the same
conclusion that JWZ did--that is, all the open source
in the world cannot save Mozilla at this point. 
Mozilla is pretty much hopeless.

I think Mozilla's biggest problem was XUL. After
having seen what a cross-platform front-end interface
like Mozilla's XUL could be like, I am now convinced
that a native GTK+ interface would definitely be the
way to go. XUL is too bloated and far to slow for my
tastes.

Anyway, I am happy to see some progress being made on
Dillo, and what's more, in the areas that really need
it the most, like Networking, I/O, and implementing
tables/frames.

It is also interesting that dw (formerly gzw, I
assume) is being re-writeen from scratch. Seems like
this is rather what Mozilla did with Gecko.

As to tables/frames, how is it going to be done? I
recall some discussions with Armadillo about possibly
doing it by embedding dw within dw. Tables are
admittedly a little bit different from frames, but I
do think they are almost like flip sides of the same
coin.

Anyway, I unfortunately don't know too much about
Dillo internals, C/C++, or GTK+. So would somebody
like to point me to something I can do to help with
Dillo? I'd like to help if I can.

[Dillo-dev]New Dw

From: Sebastian Geerken <S.Geerken@pi...> - 2000-10-06 13:53

Hi!

I've been working on a new Dw, mainly written from scratch. I've given
up the idea of making all elements GtkWidget's, since any attempt to
work around the window size limit would be far to complicated, but
designed and begun to implement a new Dw, which mainly follows the
goal to be more similar to Gtk, because (i) the design of Gtk+ is
quite nice and proven to be usable, (ii) that will make embedding Gtk
widgets simpler, and (iii) it will be simpler to understand for
someone who knows Gtk.

It's mainly a simple copy of the Gtk structures: there is a DwWidget
(sorry for the doubled "widget"), derived from GtkObject and with
similar methods as GtkWidget, a DwContainer, and structures like
DwRectangle, DwAllocation etc. with 32 bit sizes. Furthermore there is
a Gtk+ widget GtkDwViewport, which embeds a DwWidget (more directly
than the old GtkDwView), and is, from the view of Gtk+, parent of all
Gtk+ widgets that are embedded in the DwWidgets. DwContainers will
simply have to report all their children (DwWidget's as well as
GtkWidget's), and GtkDwViewport will recursively sort out the
GtkWidget's (by the GTK_IS_WIDGET macro), so implementing a
DwContainer is not more complicated than implementing a GtkContainer.

Currently, there are still many bugs, especially severe expose
problems for embedded Gtk+ widgets, and DwWidget is still quite
incomplete. After fixing the most severe bugs, I'll try to integrate
the new Dw (which currently runs in a testbed) into dillo soon, trying
to complete it in dillo itself. There is already a halfway working
DwPage (a port of my Gtk+ port of the old DwPage, to the new Dw).

I'll send the sources to anyone who is interested, and I would be glad
about help from someone else who knows Gtk+ good.
