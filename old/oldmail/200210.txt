Most probably the server crashed during the weekend and it took them
a while to get it up again (considering, I think, most of us were more
interested in the election results than going to work :-P).

Yes. I didn't answer yet because I'm going to make the contacts you

Humm, I don't know about history support, it shouldn't be too hard
to do, but I think that would be the "wrong" way to fix your problem.
But about the infinite growing cache, I made a patch to control the
size of Dillo's cache (even set it to zero - which in practise will
disable it):

http://www.ime.usp.br/~livio/dillo/patches/cache-size-limit.diff

The patch _should_ apply to current release/CVS. Some files might
shift a bit, but I think it still works. The option you'll be looking
for in you dillorc is `cache_size`.

But I'm not sure your memory increase is cache related. If you apply
my patch it will enable an `about:cache` page where you can see what
files are currently cached, and much of cache they are occupying
(never forget to reload it to update the info! ;). Maybe what you see
is just a memory leak in the code... There is a rather complete e-mail
I've sent about this patch, back in June. It's here:
http://so....net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=1642897

good luck!

[Dillo-dev]memory leak?

From: Marc E. Fiuczynski <mef@cs...> - 2002-10-28 18:53

Hi,

I am using dillo as a rendering engine for my digital picture frame
project --- converting an old laptop into an asthetic looking picture frame.
Lacking client-side scripting support, I am using http-equiv="refresh" to
cycle through a set of pictures being served via WiFi from my thttpd server.

After running this for 24 hours, I noticed that the dillo memory footprint
slowly grows. The footprint seems to grow at 4K increments. My conjecture is
that dillo's cache or history is slowly growing.

Is there a convinient way to disable the cache and history support?

Thanks,

Great!, i was looking at some cached pages at google and it says the
there is not much done on DPI, but now knowing that the framework is
complete and working is a great advance, i'm very interested to see it,
and do some testings.

Also don't spect that i passed 2 years learning lazy C, no way i'm a
serious programmer (or a freak it's much the same) in whatever the
languaje is, specially C/C++, also these 2 years are with pure C apps, i
have worked more with C libraries doing the heavy work for some VB
programs, and mixed with some x86 and mmx assembly.

Ok, i'll wait to see the tarball posted, and then i'll start coding with
it.

Anyway, anyone working on downloads?, i whould like to know if there is
something already instead of trying to start from scratch some basic
stuff for a download plugin.

Talking about DPI1, I just "finished" a dpi-program for
bookmarks: 1690 lines that need some polishing, but that make an
excellent example.

The code is well commented but there's still a small doc to
write before sharing it and starting coding dpis!

I was waiting for someone from CIPSGA to write back to one of
our multiple attempts to contact them :(, but if things continue
this way I'll pack a tarball with it and put it on the HTTP
server next week.

If some more time passes by and we still have no answers, we'll
have to search for another CVS server...

Sorry for adding this: This would not just extend HTTP, but *break*
it. If the server does send a Content-Type, the browser MUST adhere to
it. Any solution to "solve" this "problem" would make dillo's behavior
simply incorrect, not only more tolerant. (Adding detection code for
the case that no Content-Type is sent, would OTOH ok, see the HTTP
specs.)

I've written some notes to the list, they can be found at
<http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/702/2002/4/0/8538786/>. Furthermore,
there are documentations on Dw within the tarball.

Some more notes:

e.g. DwPage (most likely) must handle floats, fixed positions

* Another complex task is CSS parsing and evaluation, handling
document elements, and synchronizing the whole thing. (On the other

Floats are something mainly affecting DwPage, but also will probably
make the document tree more complicated. I've until now collected some
ideas; who is interested in an implementation, may ask me to write
them down. Of course, be warned that it is no simple task.

Dillo is heavily threaded, so you can't depend on the dimensions being
loaded at any specific point. You should just assume a zero-width picture
until you know the dimensions, at which point you'll need to re-render.

Sorry, small correction....

absolute-positioned elements do not affect the normal text flow (text simply flows under/over such elements) so the question about text rendering as it's parsed is irrelevant as float:left and float:right (and img align=right) have to appear before the text that will subsequently flow around them.

OK first hurdle down, but there is still the problem of images in floated elements being of undetermined dimensions (as they are being retrieved by a separate thread at this point). So the problem is this...

A piece of HTML is encountered like this...
<img src='wherever.png' align=right>loads of text goes here that now needs to flow around the image that has just been loaded...

The IMG tag will get pushed to the parsing stack, but are the image's dimensions retrieved before the following words are rendered?

There is no problem with <DIV> elements floated that include only text, as the CSS2 spec says that the element's width should be provided in the css and if not is left up to the browser to decide.

Could someone give me a quick pointer as to wether the images dimensions are loaded before subsequent text rendering, or if not, can it be?

While developing a web application for downloading data to client PCs I had
to investigate the behaviour of various browsers to discover a common method
to download the data (which happened to be comma seperated values.) For
all but IE the browser accepted application/octet-stream and displayed the
usually SaveFile dialog. IE ignored application/octet-stream and started up
a spread sheet to display the data. In the end I had to create a new x-
MIME type to ensure that IE never assumed it knew better than the server.

From experimentation and some info I found on microsoft's web site I would
say that IE will ignore both MIME and name suffix if it sees data it
_thinks_ it can display or execute.

This kind of policy, of course, just perpetuates bad server configurations.

Recently I had reason to actually check the true contents of a large number
of GIF files obtained from the web (and no, they were not porn :-)) Around
80% were in fact JPG files. All the mainstream browsers seem to check the
file contents signatures (similar to the file command.) IE will agressively
search for content that it conciders displayable and/or executable no matter
what MIME information is supplied (which led to the famous security problem
cause by JavaScript hidden in the GIF comment field.)

It's a sad state of affairs.

The page is rendered during download.

For example, the ending paragraph may contain a <DIV class that positions it at the top of the page, and it's width/height may be dependant on an image that hasn't been loaded by the time the first few paragraphs have been rendered.

Hummm, so? The page is just re-rendered, like it is today. If info
about an image is not downloaded yet the page is rendered in a certain
way, and after the info (width and height) is received it is
re-rendered. Same goes for tables and other stuff.. 

Try using a slow connection on a slow site. Watch Dillo (or even
Mozilla, Opera or Konqueror for that matter) and see how the rendering
"evolves" during download. Of course the objects are pushed about the
page until you download the entire page (and info about other
elements, like images).

The only other way I see of doing this is to do what Netscape 4
did. Download enough info to determine what the page layout will be
and only then render it. In my opinion that's just horrible for the
user. I _really_ want to see the page during download, _even_ if the
layout keeps "shifting" about.

To sum it up, I think rendering at download-time is very adequate
and imposes no barrier to implementing CSS.

Hi,

Could someone answer me a quick question about the HTML parsing process please....

It appears from the docs that the style info for text that is to be rendered is held in a parsing stack, which is pushed each time a new tag arrives and subsequently popped when the tag is closed. From this, can I infer that html page text is being rendered as it is being received? or is rendering delayed until the complete page has been read and the parsing stack built?

If the page text is being rendered as it is encountered (as suspected) then I doubt CSS (or for that matter, even an align=right img tag) can be implemented in the code's current form. For example, the ending paragraph may contain a <DIV class that positions it at the top of the page, and it's width/height may be dependant on an image that hasn't been loaded by the time the first few paragraphs have been rendered.

Could someone verify wether the text rendering is done during page content parsing or deferred please?

In fact, this is not a simple case. Dillo has code for autodetecting 
content type when content-type header is missing. This does not seem
to be a case here - application/octet-stream is valid content type and 
means something for what browser may prompt to download but should not 
try to show it by itself. Mozilla and IE probably looked file extension, 
but this kind of behavior is imho problematic - if you really want user 
to be prompted for download and configure web server to send 
application/octet-stream content-type but web browser tries to show it 
anyway because file extension, then this is not a wanted behavior. It is 
just guessing.

Re: [Dillo-dev]plans for CSS support?

I don't know how feasable it will be to retro-fit CSS to the code. Certainly if I was starting from scratch then i'd make sure every HTML 'object' (be it an image, table, H1 or body piece of text, etc) had css properties (padding, margin, colour, etc) and then alter those default CSS properties with any stylesheet information that was encountered. Certainly the img align=right html tag is really a CSS property. I will have a look at the code and see if I can get my head around it. In the meantime if anyone else is interested in helping please say so.

My reasons for not wanting it in Dillo are that it will bloat the
code, and also it means looking at each stream to decide what it is,
instead of just looking at the content type. This would harm it's use
in embedded systems.

There is always the option of using a separate proxy application to
re-write the content type headers.

Jorge & John,

While I agree that the fix should be at the server side, I don't think it is
prudent for dillo to not work in simple cases. I doubt that dillo's
following is so huge that by not being so tollerant as other web browsers it
will change the implementation of today's web servers.

My "primary" interest in using dillo is the fact that it is small. This is
because I have a need for a free small memory footprint browser for my
application (converting an old pentium laptop to a digital picture frame).
To be totally honest (and risking to alienate people on this list), I'd
switch to another web browser in a heart beat if it worked with more of
today's web servers and html content (e.g., supporting client side
scripting, style sheets, etc.).

That's the point.

Also, beacuase being as tolerant as IE or Mozilla or $* to

Yes, and probably on the content of the stream as well.

Personally, I think that that is not something that should be added to
Dillo, because the real solution is to fix the server.

Yes, the content/type should have been either:

- image/jpeg
- image/jpg
- image/pjpeg

not "application/octet-stream".

Yes, Sebastian developed a nice document on how a possible

Hmmm, this is not a trivial task. If you have a suitable amount
of time (this depends on your understanding of GTK+ and Dw),
please ask me back and I'll send you the doc.

There have been mumblings of CSS, but I don't think anybody took it upon
themselves. One thing that I'd particularly like to see, that is (I
believe) part of CSS, is image (object) align, i.e. text flowing around
images. Many pages depend on this, either as CSS or in the deprecated <img
align=3Dleft> form.

[Dillo-dev]Silly problem

From: Marc E. Fiuczynski <mef@cs...> - 2002-10-23 02:03

Hi,

When I open an HTML page with a JPEG image source, dillo says that it cannot
open up the application/octet-stream MIME type. Well, I should send you the
exact error message in a later message.

The html page is simply contains and is being served from a thttpd version
2.1 server:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<IMG src="pics/foo.jpg">
</BODY>
</HTML>

There is no problem in opening this page from Internet Explorer or Mozilla
from the thttpd server.

Any insights?

I've read the site a couple of times, and still have a bunch of

But yes, 1500 is the current maximum amount.

Things are quiet mainly because Sebastian is under a heavy work
load, Livio is very busy too, and I'm still trying to settle
to keep things rolling.

Anyway, in the mean time, I've managed to develop 1400 lines of
a dpi server (to illustrate how the whole thing works), what it
can do, and what it does now.

This is certainly good news!

BTW, has someone started making a dpi-server?

I'm trying hard to get the CIPSGA CVS set, but if it doesn't
happen soon, I'll fall back to the tarball scheme, at least until
I find a good solution.

As for the release, once the dpi updates go to CVS, it will be
a matter of polishing, integrating some patches, getting sure it
works solid, and 0.7.0 will be ready.

Ah, last but not the least, Dillo is applying at linuxfund for
some funds, so you may help the project by visiting:

http://www.linuxfund.org

and _voting_ some pesos from there.

Note: this is not a real money transfer, but virtual money
that's assigned to the project. When the round ends, the internal
"board" considers the highest voted projects and decides how much
real money to grant.

[Dillo-dev]local browsing (offline) patch updated

From: Melvin Hadasht <melvin.hadasht@fr...> - 2002-10-14 22:12

Hi,

I updated my localhost-only browsing (aka offline mode) such it is now possible
to switch the offline mode on and off while browsing (menu File->Work offline
can be toggled). It is still possible to start directly in offline mode with
the "-l" command line option. The patch (6k) is at

http://melvin.hadasht.free.fr/home/dillo/local/

The patch adds two new files (offline.[ch]) and modifies src/Makefile.am, so you
may need to run automake etc.

The objective of this patch is primarily to make the mail client Sylpheed-Claws
render HTML mails in a secure way while providing the possibility to switch to
online mode when the user wants it (patches for Sylpheed-Claws are on the same
site).

From the technical point of view, this patch works a bit differently than the
last one. Instead of storing a 0 (null) IP in the cache to disallow
non-localhost browsing, it now stores the correct IP but returns 0 (null) to the
caller only when offline browsing is on. This saves a DNS lookup when offline
mode is switched off and seems to be more logical (even if that means two places
to patch instead of only one).

Another difference is that the offline state is no more stored in dns.[ch]
but in new files called offline.[ch]. These files are also responsible for
setting the mode and for updating the menus of the different browser window
(so the state offline on/off is consistent across windows.). 

(With this scheme, it could be also possible to create a blacklist of hosts
that should never be accessed. But that would need more work...)

PS: IIRC, I read on the ML that the developers are continuing developing on a
CVS repository that is not open to the public because of problems with CVS
hosting. Is it possible to have a newer cvs snapshot (tar ball) downloadable
from the web site so contributers can work on more uptodate versions? I hope
the Dillo project is still alive.

As always, any comments are welcome.

Cheers

I'm not sure if this is the right place to send this, but I never heard 
back from the address I tried earlier.

I've started packaging a Dillo 0.6.6 RPM for Red Hat 7.3. I've added a 
menu entry in the /etc/X11/applnk area (which should be shared by Gnome and 
KDE, but isn't always), using one of the icons from the Dillo home page, 
and I've included a couple of patches: Melvin Hadasht's combined 
command-line/embeddable/fullwindow/local browsing patch 
(http://melvin.hadasht.free.fr/home/index.html) and the remote access patch 
from Sean's XEmacs Stuff (http://xemacs.seanm.ca/). It's compiled with 
cookies enabled.

i can backport these changes to the 0.6.6, but the modified cvs version 
seems more reliable to me since i have used it long time without

Changelog:

The sourceforge CVS version have been unmodified for some months now and

Seems a bit restrictive to me.

Is the CVS version much improved since the 0.6.6? Is it better to switch over
to that for some bleeding edge tests?

This is what all browsers do now. Doing something else is would possibly be
following the RFC better, but it would then behave differently from the
others.

This is caused by dillo cache, which believes that a cached document is 
valid forever. Since the url is same as it was, dillo will show the 
document from cache. I have patch for solving this, but it is against 
sourceforge cvs version and i am waiting new dillo release to update it.
Older 0.6.6 patch (which is avaible in mix which some other modifications 
at http://www.zone.ee/myzz/dillo/dillo-0.6.6-mzz.diff) checks only 307 
redirect and cache: headers, but not 302 redirect.

As a side note, RFC 2616 is a bit confusing about what 302 redirect should 
do for POST request:

10.3.3 302 Found

The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI.
Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD
continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response
is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header
field.

The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the
response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the
response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to
the new URI(s).
If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other
than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the
request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might
change the conditions under which the request was issued.

Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed
to change the method on the redirected request. However, most
existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303
response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless
of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have
been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which
kind of reaction is expected of the client.

[Dillo-dev]Problems and questions on Dillo 0.6.6

From: Daniel Stenberg <daniel@ha...> - 2002-10-04 13:43

Hey Dillo developers.

I recently discovered Dillo and have plans on using it for an embedded
project. However, my first tests with dillo 0.6.6 on my Linux browser on
some sample pages left me a bit disapppointed, but this may very well be due
to my own ignorance or stupidity. Hence my mail here.

I tried a login-page. It is a plain HTML form querying for user and password.
I entered them both and pressed 'login'. It sent them off fine in a POST.

The remote site sends back a 302 with a Location: back to the exactly same
URL I was already browsing (the one with the form). Oh, right, and I got a
Cookie-Set back.

Dillon does not do anything on this response, it just shows the same login
screen again (while a working browser would send back a GET and as that new
cookie is used, get something entirely different back). I assume this is a
bad caching issue since it might believe that it already has the page cached
and thus shows that.

Now, it is supposed to have received a cookie. My .dillo/cookierc looks like
this:

--- start ---
DEFAULT DENY
.domain.tld ACCEPT
--- end ----
[.domain.tld is something else in real life]

Isn't this the way it is supposed to work?

Now, if I reload the page, Dillo does perform a GET for the page, but it does
not send along the cookie "correctly". Etherealing on the HTTP traffic
clearly shows that the request doesn't include the cookie the correct way in
the request (but it does send a Cookie2: header that puzzles me) and thus
this doesn't help and yes, I get back that same login page again.

Anyone recognize this?

Another issue, is there anyone who has any experience on running Dillo on
GTKfb? If all I want to do in an embedded Linux system is running Dillo, it
does seem like a cool way to avoid X all together.

I'm sorry if this is all just RTFM, but I've actually tried to find the
answers to these questions. I'd be glad to read more if you can just point to
which docs I should study!

The CVS version of dillo has changed some data structures. Try replacing
word->content.text with word->content.data.text and you should be fine.

I (thought I had) said, that this error disappeared for me when I
updated the Xft/Xrender/fontconfig libraries available from
fontconfig.org.

It's a pity, Pango has other features that are nice to have. I
wouldn't know how to display pages properly with Pango anyway...

Ah, but the beauty of Pango is that we get support for loads of different character sets, E.G. Japanese.

I'm currently trying to port the Xft patch to the GTK2 stuff. That would
fix the layout problems and bring it up to an acceptable performance
level too. Pango just doesn't seem to cut it for this kind of job.

I have a problem whan compile dillo with xft patch..
I use cvs version, and I patch manualy because the patch return a few errors.

dw_page.c: In function `Dw_page_draw_line':
dw_page.c:1021: warning: implicit declaration of function `XftDrawDrawable'
dw_page.c:1048: structure has no member named `text'

[Dillo-dev]Tor's Xft patch

From: Nicola Girardi <nicola@g-...> - 2002-10-01 15:26

Today I tried Tor's Xft patch which was posted on this list. You
need to add -lXft and -lfontconfig to make it work. The result, as
far as antialiasing is concerned, is much better than with the GTK2
patch; in the latter, Dillo's layout was partially ruined by large
gaps between lines and images not positioned correctly (at least
when images happen in text like ``something in <img src="this.jpg">
line'').

At least this happens with my configuration.

I'd really suggest you try that nice Xft patch.
