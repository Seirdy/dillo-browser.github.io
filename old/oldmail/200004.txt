Excellent, if you feel like updating it...

I wish it to be a mirror rather than a URL redirection.
I'll keep the bug track engine and the primary site in the new server
(dillo.inf.utfsm.cl) and use sourceforge to handle heavy network traffic
(downloads and home page).

Update it, no problem (please delete the old tarball)

Not first priority. If updated, it would work as a checkout only.

Thanks, please contact James and ask him the SW permissions to do that.
It would be nice to announce the project in sourceforge news too...
Please remember that this is a DEVELOPER's release. Not for USERS.

The bug-track is healthy and working, check it at:

(it is was designed for this project, so we'll keep it)

[Dillo-dev]Sourceforge

From: <bigdaddy@ll...> - 2000-04-24 01:45

I noticed that dillo is only using about 30% of all the sourceforge
resources that it could.
I.E. - The there is no webpage at http://dillo.so....net
The ftp on sourceforge is very outdated.
The CVS hasn't been updated in a while
So on, and so forth.
I think it might be a good idea to update the sourceforge stuff. It might
help to bring more developers into the project.
At a minimum- make a re-direct on the dillo.so....net page to the
real homepage, and update the ftp tarball. 
Switching over to sourceforge's bugtracking might not be a bad idea, but
since we already have an engine for that (though last time I checked it
wasn't working) it is not a high priority.

Does anybody else have any thoughts?

[Dillo-dev]Progress

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2000-04-20 01:44

Hello crew!

The new server is almost set; just need to recompile the CGIs
and it will be ready!

The cache rewrite is in progress, I just finished writing a
whole new IO engine; the cache will be based on it, and the rest
of Dillo will use the cache API.

Please remember that after that's done, and the CPU hogging
problem is fixed, we'll make a freshmeat announce!

[Dillo-dev]CPU Hogging

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2000-04-12 13:21

Hello list!

Greetings to the new members, and to the old ones!

Some news from current project-status:

I've been working with the CPU-hogging problem, and after
fixing several things here and there (dns.c, socket.c, http.c,
IO.c, IO.h, web.c, cache.c...), it's a decision: I'll rewrite the
cache module.

The cache module is split among several different parts in the
code, and integrated in a subtle way with some others. Getting
the idea of the data flow (and the algorithms) becomes a titanic
task, and maintenance is almost impossible. Ah, and it's broken!

Now I'm working on it, and when its done: a new tarball will be
released. After that, we'll set dillo.so....net to be a
mirror of our main site, and I'll make a freshmeat announce "urbi
et orbi". 

The new site server is almost ready. Just need to move the
database and the bug-track engine there...

If you feel like patching dillo, please focus on the rendering
part for now; the low level routines are under heavy
reconstruction.


Best regards
Jorge.-



Ps: If you want to get a tarball with what's currently done, let
me know, just to put it online.
Ps2: Don't use the CVS now, it's outdated, and when we get it
sync. it will serve as a checkout only. 



[Dillo-dev]CPU hogging (part 1)

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@me...> - 2000-04-05 14:27

Hi,

I just fixed the short CPU hogging that happened when waiting 
for a DNS query. (Look bug #50 in the bug-track).
This doesn't mean that the whole CPU hogging problem is solved. Our
mailing-list-archives-link still hogs the CPU (And forever).
I'll focus on that now.

I don't buy this. I've tried calling up my own web page at:

http://www.iag.net/~aleris

and sometimes it causes CPU hogging, sometimes it doesn't. It doesn't seem to be
tied into the threading system at this point; I disabled threading support and
it still happens. Somewhere there is a piece of code that drops into a nearly
infinite loop or something. I suspect it is somewhere in the vicinity of the DNS
resolution code but I can't prove it yet.

The latter may be a better idea. This code is a mess, and we'll end up
spending more time trying to figure the code out than we will fixing it.
We should probably aim at a gradual rewrite of the browser itself before
we start shoehorning new features into the current architecture.

Go to Sourceforge and indicate to their systems that "Greslin" is one of
your developers. This will give me update access to the CVS tree.

OK, I've been workink on that.
It is NOT the threading system!
Actually, what causes the problem is URL redirection. If you hit a
redirected URL, the CPU will be hogged.

> Before we get too deep in making it pretty, we need to improve the infrastructure.
> The alternative is to end up with Netscape Communicator. :(

Yes man, I agree.
Have you figured out the whole mess that we had before this release?

Well, technically talking I've been studying the problem and almost
every problem comes from the IO engine change. It behaves asynchronously
but, it was struggled-in without the minimal considerations about that
kind of processing. I mean, several critical races were introduced and
it was merged with the former (streamed) implementatiom. Frankly I'm not
sure now if trying to fix it, or plainly rewriting it.

The cache system integrates with the IO and it is also obscure :-(
I still can't find a clear way of using it and handling close and abort
requests the way it should be so, basically I'm studying the code now
to try to find whether to heavily fix it or to change it.
As a matter of fact, this would not be the first module rewrite in the
project.

If you suggest me an IRC channel now, 
no problem to meet you there.

Right now I'm far more concerned about this runaway CPU usage. Dillo compiled
great out of the box, and it looks good and stable. But after only calling up
a page or two, it started grabbing 98% of my CPU. This is absolutely unacceptable.

Does anyone have any idea what is causing this? I assume Dillo is using a
threading system of some kind; could this be the problem?

Before we get too deep in making it pretty, we need to improve the infrastructure.
The alternative is to end up with Netscape Communicator. :(

Just sometimes. You may have to resize the window or go back
and forward to fix the display.
This is a Dillo-Widget bug.
I think its due to initialization problems. If you look at it
in detail, you'll notice that sometimes, a gray square renders on
top of the page (try loading a small image for instance), and
that its height is exactly the same of the whole set of toolbars.
Some other times, small HTML pages "appear" with an upward
shift...

Yes, what we have here is not a single thread problem but an
asynchronous race condition. That explains the variations. If you
try it several times, with different CPU loads for instance, you
may notice diferences with the same gtk-theme.

Not every file. The problem is mainly with Dillo bug-track

want to keep it there (Is faster an easier to administrate).

Well, our beloved Dillo is far away from challenging those big
ones, but its speed and anti-bloat design are addictive!
(We'll try to make it render the whole HTML 4.0 before thinking
of extending it. And when I say "render HTML 4.0", I mean to have
the info displayed in a suitable way.)

Actually we have, but I'll try to set it up on another server,

Sure, there're those URLs too.
I think that a good guess can be done using the last filename:
If it has a '.', most probably it's a dir!
You have to check it for POST or GET or whatever before making
the gess though.
The sure way to proceed is to check the RFC.

I just saw your announcement on gtk-app-devel. All I can say is, good. It's
good to know that someone's picked up gzilla from the dustbin; I hate to think

--------------------
gtk announce follows
--------------------
Hi there,

I only hope this to be the right place for this announcement; please
don't suggest freshmeat cause Dillo is still alpha code.

Dillo is a gtk+based web browser that's very fast, lean and extensible.
It has its own HTML parsing routines, is written completely in C and the
tarball is just 200Kb! (The stripped binary is also 200Kb).
There's no support for Java, javascript.

We are in need of developers; those of you who feel interested in
this project, or just wnat more info, take a look at

http://academico.inf.utfsm.cl:81/~jcid/Dillo/project.html

you'll find everything there.

Yes, we can, but later...
Why?

1.- Because I need to address server traffic concerns.
Currently the source is in the academico server and also at
ftp://ftp.so....net/pub/sourceforge/dillo/dillo-0.1.0.tar.gz 
The first one is not able to handle a big load, as what could
be generated by a freshmeat announce, and the second one is very
slow and unreliable. This week I'll set up a new server, and
maybe put the source on a ftp port with a maximum concurrent
connection limit. 
The best setting (IMHO) is to have dillo source at:
http://dillo.so....net/dillo-0.1.0.tar.gz
and everything else in the new server.

2.- Because we need more developers, and the gtk mailing list
is a better place to find gtk skilled guys. The freshmeat list
has a broader range, and our release is not ready for users yet.
(Anyway, if the gtk-mailing-list announce fails to bring new
devels. to the project, a freshmeat one will follow quickly!)


Jorge.-


Ps: James, would you mind setting the
http://dillo.so....net/dillo-0.1.0.tar.gz URL?

this is a minor thingie ...
when you enter an url like this:

dillo must put a '/' behind this .. i have already found the place in

where it should happen, but i was thinking :

how can you know this is a directory ? i'm thinking of this :
i can add a test to see if there are any '.' or '?' in the tail (in this
example
/rlnews) (the ? is for queries which can be without a dot but may not
get a
trailing '/' for example :
http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&sc=on&hl=on&q=dillo&kl=XX&stype=stext
