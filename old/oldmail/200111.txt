this delay is the reason why I suggested having a config directive to
turn this on/off. 
Of course, it would be theoretically possible to maintain a list of
sites that should always check for updates and the rest shouldn't, but
this seems to be over-complicated for me and doesn't fit in dillo's
design goals.

I agree a lot! Any kind of news page (slashdot, The Register, Bulletin
Boards) suffer from lack of updates, I have to manually reload them all the
time. I would love to see this fixed, but worry slightly if this will slow
down Dillo overall because we'd need to contact the server every time,
which seems to take the most time.

or, alternatively (what I forgot to mention) we could use conditional

hi guys,

I took a quick look in the docs and the source, and it _seems_ that
dillo doesn't check for updates for a cached object automatically. Is
there any reason for it, or just simply not implemented yet?
I suggest at least having a new directive in dillorc for cache

we should use http's HEAD method to compare the cached and actual

[Dillo-dev]Link to Japanese support patch seems to be down.

From: <jserv.bbs@go...> - 2001-11-28 09:09

Hi, all:

While I attempted to consult the [Japanese support patch] in the section
of [i18n & l10n] in Dillo Links page (http://dillo.so....net/Links.html)
, I found that the link http://www.ee.ed.ac.uk/~rjt/dillo/japanese.html could
not be reachable.

I am a user form Taiwan and about to make efforts to Chinese support for
Dillo. So I hope to refer the Japanese support patch in advance.

Does anyone knows the link or give me that patch? Thanks.

Regards,
Jim Huang

[Dillo-dev][patch] Let Dillo display Traditional Chinese pages.

From: <jserv.bbs@go...> - 2001-11-28 08:32

Hi, all:

I am a new user to Dillo Web Browser from Taiwan. I found it really
nice for searching or browser. However, I also noticed that Dillo couldn't
display Chinese Web page well, resulting from the fact that Dillo is not
built in the manner of i18n programming paradigm.

So, I did a patch to Dillo to let Dillo support Traditional Chinese
(the language used widely in Taiwan) display and its encoding, Big-5.
As follows:

in src/dw_style.c:

static void Dw_style_font_realize (DwStyleFont *font, gboolean try_all)
{
char fontname[256], *ItalicChar;

ItalicChar = prefs.use_oblique ? "o" : "i";
sprintf (fontname,
"-*-%s-%s-%s-*-*-%d-*-75-75-*-*-iso8859-1",
font->name,
font->bold ? "bold" : "medium",
font->italic ? ItalicChar : "r",
font->size);
++ strcat (fontname,
++ ",-arphic technology co.-ar pl mingti2l big5"
++ "-medium-r-normal-*-*-160-*-*-c-*-big5-0");
-- font->font = gdk_font_load(fontname);
++ font->font = gdk_fontset_load(fontname);

Here, I suppose that Taiwan Linux users all have "ar pl mingti2l big5"
font provided by Arphic Technology. It seems to be stupid but it works
like this:

[Dillo-dev]Here's a URL parsing hack...

Attachments: url.diff      

I grew tired of the javascript links that didn't work
even though it was obvious to me that there was a URL
embedded in that javascript. I hacked the url parser
so that it looks for an embedded " if all else
fails. At the very least this fixes a bunch of the
links when I view news.yahoo.com.

It's okay to post hacks here, right?

Why not use libguile? It is the official extension language of the 
GNU Project, and would allow fast plugin development. Best part is 
that you can load C code from it with (load-extension "libfoo" 
init_function) (the .so and version stuff is added automatically). 
This is only in unstable guile from CVS though (which is _much_ 
improved over 1.4). So, people could write their plugins in C if they 
wanted and simply load it into scheme and attach it to dillo, or they 
could write the plugin entirely in scheme (or some combination of the 
two). There is the problem of added memory used by guile though (last 
time I checked guile used something like 8MB of vm, with about 2MB 
resident at any time).

Sure.

Currently I'm concerned with rfc2396 (details at bug-track),
and there're still some patches waiting to be merged before
releasing dillo-0.6.3.

Also there's the whole subject of source forge and whether or
not moving away...

The plan is to restart working the simple-plugins after 0.6.3
release.

Note that this scheme is far from what's commonly known as a
plugin. It's more close to a fast-cgi interface than a dlopen
handled module.

[Dillo-dev]dillo on QNX

From: Bjoern Weber <foxbow@we...> - 2001-11-27 08:37

Good morning,

as I wrote before, I'm testing out dillo on the QNX RTP 6.1
and so far as I'm concerned it runs smooth, yet not as stable
as on other platforms. I'm just wondering if anyone else out
there is interested in running dillo on that platform or has
been testing it so we can corporate our efforts to mark out
the last flaws.

*delurking*

I have also thought about using standalone programs to keep dillo
from getting bloated while adding features. I thought that it could
be done by implementing a "local CGI" feature, then writing CGI-like
programs that output HTML forms and modify a user's local config files.
It seems entirely reasonable to me to implement the entire "Preferences"
UI in HTML this way.

There are some drawbacks. You'd want to implement some security
around this so mischevious remote web-pages couldn't try to launch
local commands. Doing this means multiple executables, perhaps
even multiple languages.

I don't think that SGML cares about whitespace in tags...that 
probably should be valid html. I think that the XML standard says 
something about this (white space not mattering, making that valid), 
and since every valid xml document is a valid sgml document, that 
would mean that dillo isn't parsing correctly. I'll go and look it up 
in the standard now...(I wish I still had my annonated standard)...I 
can't find anything that explicitly says that is wrong, but I 
attempted to validated a document that uses that and I got this 
error:

< a href=">mirrors.kernel.org</a>.

Error: end tag for element "A" which is not open; try removing the 
end tag or check for improper nesting of elements 

So, that is improper html. Linuxtoday is at fault.

While the HTML specs don't give a formal parsing rule for tags, I doubt

In a few months, I am planning to start a small online company (music 
store that only carries non-copy protected cds). If all goes well, I 
should have a server colocated somewhere before February or 
March...it will have plenty of spare bandwidth and disk space, so 
when I get it set up (filing incorporation papers, getting the other 
people in in to purchase their shares, then setting up the server and 
installing my code on it, and finally getting the first set of CDs), 
dillo can go there if you want. I plan for the server to be a mid-
range 1U p3 box with about 256MB of ram and a nice 40GB hard drive, 
all running Debian.

and also:

http://www.advogato.org/article/376.html
http://slashdot.org/developers/01/11/12/1456219.shtml



After careful consideration of these references, previous posts
on this thread and from my personal experiences, I've come to
think that unfortunately there're underhanded politics coming
from VA.

This is hard to write, specially when I'm both aware and
grateful for all that VA has given to the Open Source & Free SW
community. OTOH, I can't overlook the following points:

* After months of license discussion, Loic was asked to give up
his rights on contributions to the SF codebase (that were given
under the GPL, and expected to remain as such), but later,
without any previous warning, it was made propietary to VA.

* The SF codebase that's still free is about a year old and
in an unmaintainable state. Considering that, in conjunction with
the time it took for Loic to sign the final document (while
discussing it), the hypothesis of it all being planned seems a
very plausible one.

* Once on their server, you don't own the project. It can't be
deleted, and the only way around is to tag it "unmaintained".
This is kind of insidious! It makes people think the project is
stalled without developers, that the last release is in SF and
that there's no need to look for it elsewhere...

* Facilities for exporting projects were "temporarily" removed.

* SF is using propietary SW. There's no problem if there's a
need, but being artificial, it gives the impression that Free-SW
is not good enough for the task.

* You're still free to use the SF server, but you won't have
the freedom to copy, modify, study and distribute the SW it runs.

* Technical issue: Download counters, although being essential
information (both for a project and SF), are not working properly
since months (maybe more than five). It's bug 440446 in SF's bug
track. It was posted after a previous fix of the counters, that
were reported to even go backwards sometimes.



About dillo
-----------

I have no problems with moving dillo, even more, if that serves
to solve the download counter and the mailing list problems, it's
very welcome!

Note: mailing lists at SF are unmaintained by now, as they're
working on a new solution... With regard to dillo, dillo-dev was
created by James McCollough, he's the maintainer, but all my
attempts to reach him by email had failed :(. Thus, since mailman
SW started asking for an admin password, I haven't access to the
susbscribers list. SF doesn't provide a way to change this, and
my support requests remain unanswered...


What do we need to move (or distribute) dillo?

* Download bandwidth and accurate counters
* mailing list (searchable and browseable)
* CVS
* Web site with a CGI enable-policy that lasts!
* ssh shell account for Web site administration.


Savannah's future looks promising, but it doesn't seem to
provide now what we need. Anyway, if they have (at least):

* Web site with a CGI enable-policy that lasts!
* ssh shell account for Web site administration.

I'd go there, and also set:

* mailing list (if searchable and browseable)

Probably downloads can be located elsewhere cause they only
provide http downloads from a directory, but no stats AFAIK.

CVS can be set within the same machine as downloads or in
Savannah. I'm not sure which is better. Savannah has viewCVS and
that's a plus, but having downloads and CVS at the same domain
seems like a good distribution policy...

Comments, suggestions, offerings etc, are very welcomed.

Ah, if we finally decide to move, it'd be great to release
0.6.3 from the new site, probably with Livio's new design.

I'd go as stated, with CVS and downloads maintained by the
Debian-br crew!

Jorge.

Entities must start with & and end with ;, I believe the proper

I think it would be a good idea to terminate the "&nbsp" with a simicolon, like
this "&nbsp;".

Hello,

first of all I have to say thanks for your work. The Dillo is absolutely
super. Maybe I found small problem, which I believe is not difficult to fix.
The problem is with &nbsp. When I used "&nbsp" in my page I expected to see
empty space but I saw string "&nbsp" instead. I tried it in Netscape and
Mozilla and there is behavior proper (one empty space). Bellow is simple

Currently, there is a text file that controls cookies. It will allow or
deny or allow non-persistently cookies from a given domain, plus allow a
default setting.

In my opinion, not really. Very few cookies will contain the information
themselves, all they need is an identifying number that will let them look
into the database. There's no standard for the contents of cookies
whatsoever. Many are also 'encrypted'. All we can say is where they are
from, how long they will last, and who will be able to get them.

I've been thinking about how to do a good dialog to ask the user. I'm
leaning towards a standalone program that works on the cookie control
file. That way, Dillo isn't bloated with that interface, and those who
just want to use the file for control can do that.

One of the few places where I need cookies is the Dagorhir bulletin board
(www.dagorhir.com/dagorhir/infoboard). Its cookies contain the username
and password in cleartext, but it's not an important password, so it's ok.
Most places that have important passwords will either use https or just
have an identifying cookie. Trying to figure out the 'legality' of the
cookie (beyond standards conformance) is IMHO futile.

As explained above, not really. The big privacy issues aren't in the
contents of the cookie, but in how it's used.

[Dillo-dev]Font size problem with locales, and null char in text files

From: Niklas Hoglund <niklas.hoglund@te...> - 2001-11-21 21:27

I'm experiencing two bugs in Dillo 0.6.2. Firstly, if I have my
default locale setting, LC_ALL=sv_SE, Dillo ignores the font_factor
setting and displays tiny fonts. With LC_ALL=C it works OK.

Secondly, and this is more an irritating thing than a bug, when
displaying for example the changelog on Dillo's homepage every line
begins with a null character (the one used when the font lacks some
character). This only happens on text displayed with the fixed-width
font.

If it matters any, I use the Debian package of Dillo.

Except for that, you have my kudos for making a nice little program.

[Dillo-dev]it works!

From: Clinton Ebadi <unknown_lamer@ha...> - 2001-11-21 16:11

Cookies work. Yes indeed, they work well. The fact that I am sending this message from dillo proves it (i am away from my home box, and am using OpenWebMail on my mail host). This needs cookies to work, and it is working. So, any plans to merge this in to cvs? Woo, now I never have to leave dillo (I don't go anywhere that uses frames anyway). My one last reason for using anything other than dillo is gone :-) !

Thank you! It still has one problem: The order of the control file is
important, so if you have DEFAULT: DENY at the top, no (new) cookies are
allowed, regardless of what's below.

The cookie patch out there is only half of the story. Jorgen Viksell had

point taken. I can't gainsay that dillo is a *lot* better than just about
every other browser out there, in terms of memory use. Just saying that
it's not hopeless without it. :)

I run WindowMaker 0.70. I have no need for desktop evironments. I 
even have my WindowMaker settings tuned way down, so it uses a mere 
700K of ram (including all of my dock apps). I have a solid color for 
a background, and make sure to minimize my background stuff to keep 
ram for myself (about the only daemons I run are boa and cron).

I used to run Galeon in 32MB of ram, with acceptable performance. it's no
speed demon, but it's not bad. was a lot better on a Cyrix 166/32MB than Netscape
was on a 486/100/32MB. on this same machine, Mozilla was nearly unusable.

it makes a world of difference to use a lightweight window manager/desktop

[Dillo-dev]Cookies and https

From: Clinton Ebadi <unknown_lamer@ha...> - 2001-11-20 22:03

I noticed the patches for cookies and https (among other things) on 
http://haru.wom.ru/pub/dillo/patches/. Are there any plans to merge 
these into the main dillo source tree? Cookies would be useful to me 
(i.e. for viewing sites like kuro5hin where you have to be logged in 
to do important things like post). I am in a bit of a tough situation 
with dillo--it is the only browser I can use on my box, since I have 
a mere 32MB of ram (and cannot install Netscape Navigator as it is 
non-free software). Having to load konqueror to do something as 
simple as post a message to k5 is painful (especially since I can't 
do much else when running konqueror or mozilla).

If no one else wants to do it, I will manually apply the patches to 
the stuff in cvs (since cookies was done for 0.62) and submit a cvs 
diff (just ask). 

Even without cookies, dillo still rocks. Uses less than 1MB of ram 
(woo, no dicache is great!) and renders most sites (one exception: 
any of the forums in forums.newdoom.com...) extremely well. My only 
complaints would be a lack of cookies, https, frames, and disk cache 
(you see, I am on a dial-up so...). I can live without all of those 
(except maybe cookies). I had an idea for implementing frames: since 
dillo has the html widget, why not just use a GtkLayout and embed 
multiple dillo widgets inside? Anyway, I can apply those patches and 
send a big diff if you'd like (just say what patches and I'll start 
working on it when I get the message).

By the time this report was posted, rpmfind.net was down or
unaccessible from here. But now it seems to be back again and the
patch for BUG#255 I just commited, should also fix this bug!

Note: to remove duplicate variables is NOT the rigth solution.
It's a matter of resolving as RFC2396 suggests!

BTW: the current URL resolver fails a lot when contrasted with
RFC2396's examples, but it doesn't seem to cause much trouble
because it happens in not-so-common cases. Anyway, now I'm
playing with a parsing prototype that uses regular expresions. If
there's a knowledgeable volunteer (versed in url.c, RFCs, RE,
...) willing to finish it please drop me note. If not, I'll keep
working on it, because it is a very sensible part of the browser.


Cheers
Jorge.-

http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/fonts.html#generic-font-families), and
dillorc options to define them. Furthermore some changes in the
HTML parser, e.g. to use "monospace" for <PRE>,

2. an option for setting the default font, and

3. some more modifications for handling as much fonts as possible,
e.g. search for "black" fonts if a bold variant is not available
in a specific family.

(This is BTW registered as bug #176.)

Unfortunately, the work is currently on an inaccessible hard disk, I
hope to get it within the next time, until then you'll have to work
with a private modification :-)

Handling lists of fonts (also for <font> and CSS) is what
a_Dw_style_font_new_from_list (dw_style.c) was intended for.

It does not even have to be implemented. ;-)

From http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/forms.html#edef-SELECT:

The SELECT element creates a menu. Each choice offered by the menu
is represented by an OPTION element. A SELECT element must contain
at least one OPTION element.

And, on the same page before:

menus
Menus offer users options from which to choose. The SELECT
element creates a menu, in combination with the OPTGROUP and
OPTION elements.

GtkOptionMenu is indeed intended for this, while GtkCombo is a
combination of a menu and an entry. (Mozilla seems to imitate the
Windows look, rendering an option menu in a way similar to combos, but
you cannot edit the text.)

[Dillo-dev]Font Handling

From: Clinton Ebadi <unknown_lamer@ha...> - 2001-11-18 20:57

Hello, I've been looking through the source, trying to find a way to 
change the default font from helvetica to arial (helvetica scales 
really badly). I was able to change it (the font table), but that 
still makes it an ugly hack. I am going to add an option to the 
configuration file to allow for configuration of the default fonts. 
What would be the best way of doing this? My idea was to have a field 
like this:

default_fonts=foo&bar&baz

(font names separated by &), and then to write a function to parse 
this line and set the font table to use those (from what I read in 
html.c, that means I would have to rewrite some of the html init code 
to handle more than four font options), with the last font in the 
table being NULL, so the new code would know when to stop looking for 
default fonts. Of course, if you know the first font will exist 
(which is usually the case when you are overriding the defaults), why 
have more than one option? My idea for the long run (once I have more 
time to do this) is to have these options:

default_fixed_font=foo&bar
default_sans-serif_font=foo&bar
default_serif_font=foo&bar
default_font_size=10 (eventually add pt, in, cm, mm, px extensions)
default_font_style=sans-serif (or serif / fixed)

Where you can still use more than one font (to get rid of the hard-
coded font table). So, is my idea good, or does it need any changes? 
(or is someone already doing this).

I don't maintain this code, because the dillo plugins interface has changed

Ok, it seems that this page causes the mentioned error about half the time:
http://so....net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=87

If it doesn't well then try resizing the dillo window _while_ the page is
loading (or reloading). Here's what I got this time:

Dw_table_sub_calc_col_widths (sub=0x82c63e8, width=1260419230, total_width=1260419229)

Which is bogus, so Dw_table_size_request must be doing something wrong with
it's calculations.

hope this helps,

Ever since the first change (on 0.6.2) in DwTable and DwWidget, Dillo has
sometimes been "freezing". It happens not so often (something like 2 times a
day). I have no way to reproduce this, but I've attached gdb to the frozen dillo
and it seems to be spinning at Dw_table_sub_calc_col_widths() (always!).

More precisely here's the loop in gdb:
Entry point: Dw_table_sub_calc_col_widths (sub=0x82e3f98, width=721, total_width=720).

BTW: I don't know if it's ok for `width` to be bigger than `total_width`...

loop: 
1346 do {
1351 width_norm_cols = avail_width;
1352 num_norm_cols = num_cols;
1353 for (i = 0; i < sub->num_subs; i++) {
1354 if (sub_status[i] != AT_NORM) {
1353 for (i = 0; i < sub->num_subs; i++) {
1354 if (sub_status[i] != AT_NORM) {
1353 for (i = 0; i < sub->num_subs; i++) {
1376 success = TRUE;
1377 for (i = 0; success && i < sub->num_subs; i++) {
1378 cols_per_sub = (sub->subs[i].end_col - sub->subs[i].start_col);
1380 switch (sub_status[i]) {
1383 if (width_norm_cols * cols_per_sub
1393 sub_status[i] = AT_MAX;
1396 break;
1418 success = FALSE;

Hmm it ran without errors patched against 0.6.2 for me, and since nobody

I thought about this too, but then decided that this functionality would 
be more useful as a standalone program so it can be used with other apps 
as well. Maybe Shooby's XRmouse will do the trick.

Cool! :) My interest in Dillo (in fact, my knowledge of its existence)
came from my ownership of an Agenda VR3 PDA. I'll soon be in possession
of a Sharp SL-5000 PDA, too. Unfortunately, neither come with GTK+.
(Agenda runs X11 and has FLTK. Sharp runs QtEmbeded.) My greatest dream
would be to have Dillo's interface code abstracted from GTK+, so that
it could be built against Qt and FLTK bindings, too. :)

Anyway... at least these first steps are sounding good. Thanks Jorge &

[Dillo-dev]Handhelds

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2001-11-16 20:37

Hi everyone!


Sometime ago (more than I'd like) there was a thread about
running dillo on handhelds; I wish I could have had the time to
answer it then, but my priority list was pointing to different
places...

While thinking about some issues raised there, I began to
develop an interface model and to code some bits. The good news
is that this procrastinated answer not only has ideas but also
some code news.

First, running on handhelds has never been a goal in dillo, so
developing specific modules to enable or allow some PDAs to run
dillo is more likely to be discarded. Specially if the required
code is complex, or big, or too specific.

OTOH, making dillo able to run on legacy HW is a desired
feature. And there's where handhelds may benefit.

Ironically, the main problem (IMNSHO;) of running dillo on PDAs
wasn't mentioned then: memory usage.

Dillo's dicache was taking huge amounts of memory (roughly
3xoriginal image size) for RGB buffers. And that's the main
memory consumption source. Fortunately, Livio and I were
discussing from some time ago, about a new implementation of the
dicache to allow a memory boundary. In short: The first part of
that work is done (thanks Livio!), and the CVS version uses a lot
less memory!

The second part is the user interface. Sam pointed out that the
iPAQ only has a left click (is uses a pen like device), so it was
missing a lot of the UI.

Sometimes I receive patches for very specific things that only
solve problems in a rather narrow scope. Certainly, a better
practice is to try to identify the root, and to try to develop a
model that solves the problem in a more generic way. (I don't
remember exactly, but I'd bet 90% I read that in the ANTIC
magazine, almost 20 years ago, in a best-practices section.
Caveat emptor! --FWIW my favorite at the time was ANALOG).

So I finally came out with a new UI model. Instead of making
icons even smaller, now there's the posibility of hiding the
whole control panel! (AKA full-screen mode). This will benefit
every single user, and for small resolution devices it will
increase the viewport size. And yes, it's already on CVS!

Sam also sent a patch to increase the customization granularity
of the control panel, allowing the user to chose which widgets to
hide. Unfortunately it broke some key bindings and raised
gdk-CRITICAL warnings. :(

The idea was good indeed so there's a new rewritten patch for
that on CVS. What does it mean? Now you can tailor dillo's panel
even further by hiding some widgets.

As for the pen-pointing device, I think a good solution is to
have two small buttons (rightmost part of the status bar), that
fake a middle or right click. i.e. the user presses rigth-lock
button, then the next pen-click event (a physical left) is
trapped, stopped, and a new event (right-click) is emmited. This
is not on CVS, but I'll be expecting the patch! :-)

Well, there're still some things pending, but I thought iPAQ
users would be happy to read this.

Yeeeaaaah! :-) This bug was kind of irritating me... Well, I don't know if

It looks fine, although you might want to remove the sourceforge logo as
it isn't on sourceforge...

Anyway I haven't contributed code to dillo (yet) so my opinion likely
doesn't count on this, but should it then that is how I feel about the
whole issue.

No, we haven't and we probably won't be asked to. The author (LoÃ¯c Dachary)
had contributed to the Sourceforge web site code so they needed to get his
permission to use his contributions.

> Definitely move out of there.

Well, it's not as desperate as it might seem. There was a pretty insightful
discussion at slashdot yesterday about this same issue:
(http://slashdot.org/developers/01/11/12/1456219.shtml). And another discussion
at Adgovato: (http://www.advogato.org/article/376.html).

It seems the director of sourceforge himself wrote to say what was going
on. The title of his post is `From the Site Director of Sourceforge.net` and is
near the end of the page, and the longest you'll. They have no intention of
asking any of the projects to close their source. It seems VA (Linux) Systems is
in financial difficulties and they are trying to get around it.

It won't be that bad to stay at sourceforge, but I'm very "political" about
Free Software. So my suggestion was to move in to Savannah, for example, which
is pure Free Software. But if noone else sees a point, than we might as well
just stick with sourceforge.

New home for dillo...

LÃ­vio, since you, like me, are a Brazilian guy, you certainly know cipsga...
http://www.cipsga.org.br , which plays the role of the Free Software Foundation
in Brazil (sort of) and has strived to give the community what it needs
to grow around here..

If a new home is needed to host dillo from now on, I can arrange for
it to be hosted on CIPSGA servers, which already host the
debian.org.br primary web mirror, and the pages of the debian-br group.
The Debian-br crew is responsible for the maintainance of the servers,
I am sure we can quickly arrange space and software to support
the development of the dillo web browser.

I must say, dillo has somewhat of a cult following among us in the
debian-br team :)

In fact I can tell that the imlib package suffers the same problem.
I have not been able to compile the imlib on a Sparc-NetBSD 1.3-1.5
without manually dabbling either the configure script to lie or the
sourcecode so it's able to find all the gfxlibs located in 
usr/local.

I'll sign that, yet it does not make much sense either to look for 
the headers first, forget the evidence that they're not found
and continue like nothing happened. If the libs are and headers
are required and not found, I think configure should bail out
with an error and not with a warning and produce incorrect 
makefiles/code.

I am reluctant to do that since dillo bombs out from time to time
and unless I found out if that is due to the X emulation, the gtk
port or dillo I won't tell that it's really running. Unfortunately
I was not able to reproduce the behaviour in any way so I'll keep
on watching and share my wisdom with you when it's there =)

A nice friday to you all!

Subject: great work on Dillo, keep it up.

Hi
Have been trying different web browsers on my Debian workstation to find
something that is light and fast to work on a P133 laptop I have been
given. I normally keep well away from alpha stuff but thought I would
try it since I was so disappointed with everything else I have tried.
I'm very very impressed, Dillo is fantastic and just what I have been
looking for it's really fast compared to anything else I've found. It's
light with the basic functionality I want ,open multiple windows, open
new window clicking on window, renders tables and graphics with most
operations able to be done from the keyboard. This is just to say
thanks your work is really appreciated and I will definitely be keeping
an eye on developments. There are far too many bloatware web browsers
round now this fills a gap for sure.

I noticed there is a bug report regarding viewing items on eBay, is
there anything I can do to help with this? I don't know anything about
C, but I do development for HTML and Zope if there is anything I can do
regarding testing etc. let me know.

Thanks again and have a fantastic day.

I even received a patch for this, but when reviewing the HTML
specs, it was undefined!

Netscape and Mozilla add a blank line for each <br>, but lynx
doesn't! Is hard to tell wich is right because when it's not
clearly stated in the standar, it's up to the user agent.

Personally, I tend to think that the philosophy behind HTML/XML
rendering, is to let the user agent (AKA browser) decide how to
render contents, and to allow extra fine-tunning, on appearance,
to CSS.

If anyone can provide a SPEC quote, or related work, that shows
some more light on it, it'd be appreciated.

AFAIU detecting and configuring is automake&autoconf work (they
generate configure). So, I'd suggest to get a few pthreaded SW
packages, that use autoconf stuff, and see how do they solve the
problem in *BSD.

If one of them manages to detect and configure the right
includes and libs, it'd be a matter of examining its configure.in
and pasting to dillo!

OTOH, if none of the sample packages does it right, most
probably is a bug, or problem, of the autoconf stuff...

Yes, jpeg's code is not nested inside a #ifdef; in any case, I
don't yet find very useful to add the option of excluding jpeg or
png or gif...

The point is that Jpeg libs must be found unless installed in a
weird location (as /opt/custom/vodooo/...). So usr/local/...
should be detected!

[The same strategy as for pthread is advised]

That's why dillo is listed to run in *BSD!

Please send me the details of your QNX config, so I can list it
in the platform compatibility list.

I already commited a slightly modified patch to CVS, please
test it and tell me how it does.

Note: this patch doesn't solve the problem of detecting the
installation place, it just provides a way to explicitly specify
where they are.

Note2: It's basically Sammy's patch, but I don't have a *BSD to
test it.

Let's try the above described procedure. If everything fails, a
configure option (as --without-libpthread) can be developed as a
workaround...

[Dillo-dev]email problems

Hi there!


I've been under a pretty busy schedule: big patches, lots of
email, a lot of code to review, and my nettaxi account stopped
receiving email and started bouncing it :(.

Mmmm, that's a tough problem. I dislike a lot to lose email,
so, please, those of you that sent me anything between Nov 2 and
Nov 7, please resend it to jcid@so... (I just updated
the forwarding address), or to my ematic account. Thanks.

And as we're talking about email, the [mailing list] link of
the home page was updated; please click it, an read what it says,
specially the newest subscribers.


Finally, beware that current CVS is not as stable as usual.
We're dealing with massive patches and it'll take extra work to
tune it up!

Hi!

Thanks for the hints so far. Some notes:

Two bugs have already been fixed: (i) in <PRE>, words should not be
wrapped, and (ii) crashes at long pages. Changes are in the CVS.

About Lists: I can reproduce this every time with
http://www.rti-zone.org/dillo/Html.testsuite/lists_unord.html, but not
locally, this is the reason why I did not notice the bug before. BTW,
if you look at the source, you'll find that indentation is now done by
nested widgets (for simplicity), so the problem is that somehow whole
widgets are not seen. For testing, resize the window, then the missing
lists will suddenly appear.

Just downloaded the dillo web browser really love the speed.
I am fairly new to the linux envirement. as you can see though manged to 
get dillo up and running really quick. Only ten seconds after up and 
running it froze.
Probably something from my side not sure am really fast learner took me 
about an hour to learn how to compile files without documentation. and 
would like to participate in this project
even if it's just posting little minor erros recieved. But also 
learning really fast on source codes. running mandrake 8.0 had to add a 
few files in compiling cause recieved errors the first 2 attempts but 
once I loaded the file opened with ease. I took the browser into a 
message board and it opens ok but will not open threads sends you back 
to logins. Also a little familiar with wing commander for editing if 
there is a source that can be edited into the dillo would appreciate all 
that I can play with. Thank-you for your time

The problem seems to show up when the pages are already in the cache. They may
load up fine for the first time but go back and then forward again... generally
the lists will be gone.

> http://www.rti-zone.org/dillo/Html.testsuite/lists_ord.html and
> http://www.rti-zone.org/dillo/Html.testsuite/lists_lists_unord.html render just fine...

Not exactly.. these too very seldomly get renderd incorrectly. Usually the
last list on both of these pages (30 element, and 4-nested). Try viewing these
from cache, or reloading the pages, then maybe you'll see what I mean.


And there is another issue that showed up after the changes... Some borders on
tables are rendering wider on the top then on the rest of the table. For
example:

http://www.happypenguin.org (check out the tables on the _right_ column of the
page - where they have links to other sites)
http://www.ime.usp.br/dcc/pograd/ (there is only one big table with a blue border)

Sorry I can't help out on finding these problems... but I have no time on my
hands :(

best regards to all,

[Dillo-dev]email problems

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2001-11-07 00:06

Hi there!


I've been under a pretty busy schedule: big patches, lots of
email, a lot of code to review, and my nettaxi account stopped
receiving email and started bouncing it :(.

Mmmm, that's a tough problem. I dislike a lot to lose email,
so, please, those of you that sent me anything between Nov 2 and
Nov 6, please resend it to jcid@so... (I just updated
the forwarding address), or to my ematic account. Thanks.

And as we're talking about email, the [mailing list] link of
the home page was updated; please click it, an read what it says,
specially the newest subscribers.


Finally, beware that current CVS is not as stable as usual.
We're dealing with massive patches and it'll take extra work to
tune it up!


Cheers
Jorge.-

Humm.. I seem to be getting some problems rendering lists (ordered or
unordered). But I can't come up with a single test case which fails for me 100%
of the time... here are some links to simple pages which (sometimes) shows this
problem:

http://www.ime.usp.br/~kon/MAC5755/noticias.html
http://www.ime.usp.br/dcc/posgrad/bolsas/cand-bolsa.html
http://www.ime.usp.br/dcc/posgrad/faq/faq2/node2.html
http://www.ime.usp.br/dcc/ (this is a different problem.. the links on the
right column can't be clicked)

The lists disappears altogether... (check the sources to see what I mean). But
this is not true to all lists, for example the tests at
http://www.rti-zone.org/dillo/Html.testsuite/lists_ord.html and
http://www.rti-zone.org/dillo/Html.testsuite/lists_lists_unord.html render just fine...

Besides these problems, the rest seem to be just fine. ;)

Well, as I told, I managed to get things running and I 
consider /usr/local/ a reasonable place for additional
libraries/includes, so configure should be able to find
things there as well. But as I read before, the 
(malfunctioning) --with-jpeglib= options will be working
in the next release, so the problem shall dissolve then.

[Dillo-dev]Minding my own business..optional reading : )

From: Richard <hebertrich@ya...> - 2001-11-05 19:54

Normally i mind my own business..
Sip my coffee and look in from the sidelines..

There are lots of people out there making things timeless..
Some other make huge efforts at duplicating what's been done.
A good example is IRC clients for Linux.
There are more than we can can count.
Web browsers are basically the same.
Skipstone,Galeon,Opera,Mozilla,Netscape,Explorer ( i 
stop here the page would be half-full ) All of them have 
the same basic goal.Display everything,do everything and if it does the job
half assed,well too bad.They all have plug-ins , cookies, java 
and i leave aside the graphical interface that is basically the same.

As far as i can make it they try with more or less success
to stick to the standards and render pages more or less like they
were intended to be viewed by the designer.A page seen in Explorer dosent
look the same in Netscape..

What im asking myself is this.
What has Dillo to offer that will make it unique,have a "market share"
that's his own and be able to grow and be popular ?
Certainly you can see that in the browser war, unless your browser
has something unique, has a unique approach to doing things
or something that can make the balance tip so ever lightly in it's favor 
that the best efforts of the programmers will be in the long term vain 
and Dillo would stay a project that never lifted off the runway.

Back i started with a Altair 6800 , i was programming with switches and
reading the output in bin on a row of led's.I seen lot's software since.
All the projects that have been successful software wise had something
unique and innovative.Written in C is an advantage, i grant you.
But to the user ? What are you getting him ready for as an experience 
that is unique so that Dillo gets spoken of and is turned into a
success story ?

Im interrested to the max in Dillo.
I beleive you're at a crossroads and that this browser can do real
well in the open source community.
I just havent seen any thoughts about where you guys are going.
I see feature requests that more or less are what's in other browsers.
If you can resist the traps of being just like any other browser
this project stands a fair chance.
Then again what can this project offer the end user that will make it unique ?
Im curious about your thoughts on the matter.


Yeah i know what business is it of mine ? : )

hi,

i've found two problems with the configure script. one thing
is that the --with-jpeglib & --with-jpeginc options aren't 
working. these should be fixed in the next release (i sent
in a patch). this should solve the jpeg includes not being
found in net/open/freebsd (i use freebsd).
i also sent in a patch that corrects the -pthread problem
but it probably won't come into the main tree as it was a 
rather large fix (because of the inclusion of two scripts
from autoconf to detect the hosttype). 
the problem for pthread could be solved easily though 
(also with passing a --with-libpthread option or something
alike where you can add linker options to use instead of
the default -lpthread)

Do you mean the following:

1. Go to "
2. Go then to another section, e.g.
- " or
- " or
- ...
The round corners of the titles are then drawn incorrectly:
green on grey/brown background.

This is because these images are read from an additional cache, the
DICache (Decompressed Image data), which handles only RGB data, and so
has problems with transparency.

So, this is indeed a bug.

Look at " section
"Plugins". Graphical plugins are planned, but not for the next time,
one problem is that the current rendering is not very mature, there
will be still relevant changes in it.

[Dillo-dev]configure

From: Bjoern Weber <foxbow@we...> - 2001-11-05 15:25

Something concerning the configure script.
Upon compiling dillo-0.6.2 on a sparc with NetBSD 1.5
I encountered a couple of problems with the results of
the configure script. The script found out that there was
no pthread.h (which is correct) but still insisted using it.
Although it did not find any headers for libjpeg or libpng
which are clearly installed. Interesting fact, if the
configure finds out that there is no *jpeg*.h, the matching
source will be compiled though, only the -ljpeg in the
linker options is omitted. This behaviour I could reproduce
on the sparc as well as on a qnx-X86 machine.

Should that be consider as a bug or a glitch that will be
fixed in the cleanup - I did not find a matching entry yet.

But the good thing is, after adapting the Makefile both
dillo's are running smoothly!

take a look at Galeon (galeon.so....net). it's mozilla wrapped in GTK;
so it's got Mozilla's rendering engine; but runs a lot faster and has more
user-desired features (since the user interface isn't being designed by
AOL). it still takes the same amount of memory as mozilla, due to the
rendering engine; but at least it's a lot more responsive and
user-customizable. 

I like Dillo because it has its own rendering engine; and hopefully will
be able to avoid the bloat that characterizes mozilla, when the rendering
engine is done.

Cookies are being worked on, a way to totally disable them is probably a
good idea. I like the smallness as well, but many sites don't work without
e.g. frames. And if we keep as many features as possible out in plugins,
we can keep it small.

[Dillo-dev]features .yes but which ? ( the story of the malicious cucumber.. )

From: Richard <hebertrich@ya...> - 2001-11-03 17:55

Good Morning 


Benn using Dillo for two weeks now.
Trying Dillo is a fun experience.
I was reading the bug trak ..many are more feature requests than bugs and it's by reading them
more than noticing anything peculiar that i have a lil beef..

Many of the feature enhancements requests mentioned would make dillo just like any browser.
What's fun right now about dillo is this.It dosent support JAVA ,it has NO plugins
it dosent animate ,dosent support cookies and there aint a thing wrong with this.

What is missing is downloads,frames and text cut and paste from/to the browser.

Why did i download Dillo ? Fast, no frills.
If i wanted frills id get Mozilla which i trashed and dont use.
If i need a reasonably fast browser with pulg in support for fun pages and downloads
i use Opera.

Traditional browsers are a pain.
Mostly they do many things and do them bad.
I see Dillo as the alternative to bloated,slow large and inefficient traditional browsers.

See if i need a page real quick,i use Dillo 
If i could have a fast no frils browser that supports downloads..id keep it .
I dont need cookies , animations, flash, when i want to get information quick.

I beleive Dillo has acheived this.
Fast to the point and no frills.

Downloads,frames and cut and paste of text, that would be it for me .If you put in cookies
a way to disable them totally would be cool.
Once Dillo is at that point ill put it on archive and keep it .

Nice work .
It's a great lil browser as it is, cant wait to see what's up next.

I have to agree, it doesn't matter if it only uses a small amount of
memory or cpu adding this. If you added every feature everyone wanted
as part of the main program it would be bloated and slow like the rest.
I want something that does the core things fast. I do web development
and don't consider quickly viewing source to be core, there are lots of
ways available for me to do that. I find some of the source viewers
frustrating in other apps and want to be able to choose what I use.
Since it is mainly more technical people that would want this it would
be better to have it more configurable than an internal viewer. If it's
a quick peak I want calling a basic xterm with Less will do, then a
different keybinding to have an in-depth look with something that
colours the different tags is what I want.

I came in half way through this thread since I only came across Dillo
yesterday and joined the list but wanted to express my view on it. I
think all the extra bits that other programs do well should be left to
those programs, e.g. downloading files use wget, etc. If the user has
to configure a download tool this could be considered a feature by some
IT departments as it would prevent most uses from downloading crap to
their work PC.

I noticed a few problems when browsing gtks and glibs reference documentation today.
There are alot of these things inside the html-files: &#8212; 
and they didn't show up before when using the old code version 0.62.

Is this a problem with the new tag-parsing code ?

btw: they should show up as - (minus), atleast they do so in netscape.
