A short answer will be, have a look at http://www.handhelds.org/
:)

Yes, it's running X frame buffer. Basically the anything that is
compiled for the ipaq (strongarm processor) will run on the ipaq running
linux.

I cross compiled dillo myself from my machine. Some other people
have cross compiled and put binaries onto the net too. Here is one of them
at http://www.geocities.com/glenn65535/

Hi Pigeon,

How do you get Dillo to work on the IPaq? Is it framebuffered device? I'd
like to know this because I would like to put together a bootable floppy
that runs Dillo and I have plans for purchasing an IPaq in the near future.

Thanks,
Raphael

Hi all.

I've done a little patch to basically add two features that are
really useful I reckon when I use dillo on my ipaq.

First thing is a new panal_size called "tinydouble", which is basically
based on tiny, but a bit more friendly under a small resolution under
ipaq.

Second thing is a scaling functionality. With this I can scale up and down
a web page (kind of like zooming in and out). Again this is kind of handy
when viewing webpages on a handheld device. The patch given here will
scale images only. I have actually tested with scaling fonts as well, but
the problem comes to when the text is scaled to an unreadable size. And
also I will the scaling for fonts should be hooked to the font_factor of
the preferences.

There are a few issues with this scaling feature.

Firstly, right now the image scaling works in the Html_add_widget function,
and that means it will work not only for images, but everything that uses
that
function. So far from the source code only <img> and <hr> tags make use of
that function. I didn't look at other codes in depth yet, but what is
cool will be the ability to scale anything in a webpage (like table,
forms, etc). I have a feeling there's a better way to handle this.
(I've read and tried doing the scale in image.c and dw_image.c too, but I
cannot get it to work yet.)

Second issues is, the scaling will not scale images with not width and
height attribute. Again, I think the scaling should be done in the image
part.

Third issue is, I tried hooking the spin button changes to reload the
page, it works but it's far more easier to crash dillo (and basically
keep on clicking reload can crash dillo quite quickly, too). And so I've
commented that bit for now.

BTW, screenshots for this patch at:
http://pigeond.net/ipaq/dillo1.jpg
http://pigeond.net/ipaq/dillo2.jpg
http://pigeond.net/ipaq/dillo3.jpg
http://pigeond.net/ipaq/dillo4.jpg

And the patch:
http://pigeond.net/ipaq/dillo-scale-tinydouble.patch
(Based on dillo-0.5.1 tarball)

Last but not least, this is the first time I patch dillo, so please excuse
my code if I've put anything weird or out of the coding standard :)

And, the tinydouble and scaling feature aren't actually related, but
they're quite tied up together, so I've put them into one patch, instead
of two.

This is possible, Dw_gtk_scrolled_frame_key_press has to be modified
for this. Gtk+ always delivered key press events from bottom to top,
so it does not conflict with entries etc.

This is the task of Gtk+, send a bug report ;-)

[Dillo-dev]Find Text

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2001-07-24 14:48

Hi,


I've started implementing "find text". This is important
because it IS the main reason for the 0.6.0 release hold-back.

Sebastian: I know this was in your schedule, but as your
abscence is taking longer that I thought, and as I devised a way
of implementing, I just decided to start (this will also let you
work on the other couple of bugs you told me). Please contact me
ASAP.

I have a prototype running (it works with words within tables).
Some details:

* It adds a 'findtext' method to DwContainer (table and page).
* It uses a stack to keep track of current position.


Jorge.- 



[Dillo-dev]News

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2001-07-19 18:02

Hi there!


0.6.0
-----
Don't think all of this waiting time has been wasted, there're
plenty of changes to the source that I'll commit very soon.


User manual
-----------
Among misc. patches, I received the first attempt to a user
manual (mainly hints) for dillo (thanks to Kristian A. Rink). I
worked it out and set a new copy in the main site ([Help] link).
The idea is to improve it. Anything that helps (from purely
aesthetics to content improvement). I'll be expecting patches!

Please remember that it is expected to be lean, useful and not
detailed to the extremes.

As I was reading it, the idea of making it more interactive,
as happens with the file links, looked very appealing to me;
maybe a table layout would help also.

Including some hints stated in the splash screen would
probably help.


gtk_set_locale
--------------
Martynas: I saw your bug-track entry, and read the email, but
I'm not sure still: do you mean that just adding gtk_set_locale
(at init time) solves the problem for you?


Dw patches
----------

Sebastian: I'll commit a truck-load of changes from my source
tree very soon. The patch on Dw remains identical to what I sent
you some time ago. Feel free to revert 'cum_height' to 'y_top' if
you prefer it that way.


That's all, cheers
Jorge.-

I would love hjkl vi-style scrolling too. But that could possibly
interfere with forms. Ultimately, it would be awesome to have vi-style
editing within the forms, but that's not a very high priority item.

OK, it's done.

Yes, I modified it a bit.

[Dillo-dev]Delayed release

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2001-07-14 13:15

Hi!


0.6.0 is on delay mainly due to circumstances that are beyond
our control... (HW failure! ;).

Meanwhile:

- Has anyone reproduced BUG#166?

- I've got the screenshots, but not the manual page :(


Sebastian:

I sent you the patches, but nettaxi complains it can
deliver to 'ping.de' so I forwarded it to 'lilly.ping.de'. In any
case, if it's easier for you, I can commit the patch and post the
explanation here.


That's all folks

[Dillo-dev]Leaks

Hi!

Sebastian:

Have you received my last emails? (they were about Dw leaks &
patches). I'm writing to you through the list to let you a chance
of reading them on the web if your mail server is down.

PD: the patch is finished!!!

[Dillo-dev]global dillo config file

From: Eduardo Marcel Macan <macan@co...> - 2001-07-11 17:40

Attachments: prefs.c.diff      

This is just a suggestion. I think it would be useful to support
a global configuration file for dillo, if the user does not have one in
its home directory, so I added these lines to prefs.c . If a ~/.dillo/dillorc
is not found it will try to load /etc/dillorc , this way a system wide
configuration file can be provided by the packager. It is useful for
the ipaq for instance, because it requires different defaults that can
be provided in /etc/dillorc , directly in the package. It was just a
copy/paste, maybe it could be done in a more elegant way, but anyway...

Small diff file attached.

I'm glad to inform that Eric sent me the screenshots, so that's

[Dillo-dev]Close to 0.6.0 release

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2001-07-07 21:23

Hi everyone!


I haven't posted lately, due to devote work on current code.
Although this list seems very quiet, 0.6.0-pre has been under a
stream-flow of patches and improvements! I'm confident that 0.6.0
will be a great release.

In order to get to it, there're still some pending tasks, but
we're making progress on them. Among those, I'd like to have
updated dillo-screenshots for the web site (yes, I'm asking for
a volunteer!;), and also want to include a help page.

The help page should be small, and in HTML. I'd like to have
simple dillo tips to offer our users, not a complete manual that
starts explaining from what BACK-button is!

Some things to be included:

- The main window is scrollable with:

The arrow keys,
[Ctrl] + {PgUp | PgDn | Home | End}]
Pressing the middle mouse-button

If unresponssive, focus by clicking it (but not on a link!)

- Alt + ',' and Alt +'.' serve as shortcuts for Back and
Forward. (mnemonic: they're usually the '<' and '>' keys).

- Http downloads are possible, but the interface hasn't been
finished (it's described in the project notes). If you
still want to use it, get to the link you want to download
and right click it, then select "Save link as...". You'll
get notified when its done, but nothing else.

- Ftp downloads can be got by getting the full ftp-link (use
"Copy link location"), get to a terminal and issue 'wget'
or 'curl -O' and paste the URI (usually middle button).

- Stability: dillo is more stable if you let it load the main
page before moving on (don't worry about images).

- Directories, you can use:

'file:' to get current directory
'file:~' to get your home directory

- Framed page don't render, but the progress bar shows
content. If you need badly to get to that info, then "view
source" it, try to pick the right link, and copy/paste to
the location entry (don't close the source viewer before
pasting).

- There're lots of options in 'dillorc', among them:

font_factor: defaults to 1.0, I love 1.2 and iPAQ use 0.8

panel_size: <read dillorc!>

- Dillo's control panel boxes can be torn off the main window
by dragging them from the leftmost part.

- Reload button will always request an end-to-end reload, but
it will not reload embedded images.

- <alike stuff>*


Does anyone feel like helping me with it?


Ah, finally, can anyone reproduce BUG#166? It works for me.


Cheers
Jorge.- 



[Dillo-dev]set of patches

From: Aaron Lehmann <aaronl@vi...> - 2001-07-01 22:58

Attachments: const.diff      fprintf.diff      prototypes.diff      stringopts.diff      

1) const.diff. marks some tables of constant as const. extremely minor
and stylistic, may result in some minute optimization by the compiler.

2) fprintf.diff. prefs.c seems to allocate a buffer, sprintf into it,
and immediately write into a file. that's what fprintf is for! i can't
see any reason why this change would be bad.

3) prototypes.diff. png.c uses abort() without including stdlib.h.
gcc 3.0 was nice enough to detect this ANSI violation.

4) stringopts.diff. several miscellaneous string optimizations. some
strcpys are changed to memcpys (which are often faster) and sprintfs
were changed to strcpys when this was possible. strcmps were sometimes
broken down when it made sense. this is the most major change and it
reduces the size of the binary by a few hundred bytes.


the patches applied in alphabetical order with no fuzz for me. they'll
probably work in any order.


thanks!
