[Dillo-dev]Frames

From: Sam Dennis <sam@ma...> - 2001-01-31 15:24

Apologies to anyone who's thinking of working on frames, but I've started.

Expect patches Very Soon.

[Dillo-dev]0.4.0 devel-branch

Hi!

Just a few words: The most important task is now to make 0.4.0
stable, but in future there will also be a few enhancements, in speed
and code structure (both esp. in dw_page.c).

Livio, I tried to answer your question, but my mail got lost twice:

There are the signal functions "enter_notify" and "leave_notify"
which should be used for this. Just insert your code into
Dw_image_enter_notify and Dw_image_leave_notify.

Sebastian

PS: Bugs No. 1002 and 1003 are no segfaults, I just forgot to change
the menus in the form.

Er, just one, really. How will it actually be easier to implement tables and
frames with the changes than without?

[Dillo-dev]0.4.0 development branch

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2001-01-28 13:36

Hi there!


It's been a long time without any posts, but dillo has
continued evolving silently!

The good news is that finally the new widget set (DwWidget),
by Sebastian, is available from CVS. It is not yet the main
branch, but we're strongly working to that goal. Just review the
updated web site and you'll find the details.

We need all our developing efforts concentrated in making this
new branch, as stable and featured as dillo-0.3.1 in order to
make a new release based upon it.

The new DwWidget will be the base for TABLE and FRAME support.


Any questions?, just ask!

[Dillo-dev]New Dw

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2001-01-11 16:29

Sebastian,

Finally I get news from you!!!
(I know it is NOT your fault)

Does it mean that it currently implements the same
functionallity?

Good.

I never did receive one until now :(

Yes, documentation is a big need because it constitutes
everyone else's starting point. When you finish the documentation
it will be the right moment to try the integration.

Well, my plan for the integration/polishing process is to
freeze dillo development into a bux-fixing state (no new-feature
additions), and try to work out the new Dw until it supports the
same functionallity (or more) of the 0.3.1 release.

Obviously we need the new-Dw to be potentially capable of
undertaking all the required functionallity before we start
merging.

The idea behind this is to keep a single development branch (we
have little manpower and past experiences had shown that is
better to keep focused on a single tree...), and to emerge with a
new source tree that includes the new-Dw and also provides the
older features with at least the same stability degree that 0.3.1
has now (that's the way I replaced the whole IO engine, the whole
cache system, and also the way the new internal layers got into
the code!).

Once we start with this, we'll all be working the CVS tree
(You and I with write access), and you reviewing the patches (if
you accept, of course).

On the coordination effort, I can easily set a new bug-track
for the CVS branch, so once we finish producing the 0.4.0 release
we can get back into the older one.

Up to this point, the key questions are:

Is the new Dw able to handle all the current functionallity?
Is the new-Dw potentially able to handle tables and frames?
Is it faster or slower than the current one?
Do you foresee any problems if we start now?
Is the documentation ready?
Do you feel like taking responsibility for patch reviewing and
integration for Dw related code, at least at this integration
stage?


Needless to say, I feel very motivated with this effort and I
only hope that our scarce, but very appreciated developers join
us in this big step!


Sincerely
Jorge.- 



[Dillo-dev]New bug-track

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2001-01-10 23:36

Hi,

I just finished porting the bug-track to python and moving it
to sourceforge; I hope this results in better response times for
everyone.

You may experiment some problems due to intermediate network
caches. If you receive a message saying that the requested url
doesn't exist (for a cgi), a simple reload of the previous page
solves it! i.e. a single reload of the three links in Dbugtrack
will solve the problem forever.

Unfortunately, dillo does not perform end-to-end reload
(BUG-64), so you'll need lynx or anyother to do the reloads. Once
this is done you can keep using dillo.

BTW: Bug-64 is very easy to hack-fix (a few sprinkled lines),
but the plan is to fix the URL data-passing scheme with a view to
have the required basis to solve a bunch of related problems
(We are working with Livio on it).

[Dillo-dev]jcid's nettaxi email account

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2001-01-09 00:57

Hi,

Unfortunately jcid*nettaxi.com seems to be down since the
first day of 2001; I can send but not receive any email there, if
anyone has sent me some emails this year, please resend them to
my jcid*ematic.com address.

I'll appreciate it very much because one of the things I
really dislike is to loose email, and appear as I'm the one that
doesn't answer them.


Thank you very much.
Jorge.- 



[Dillo-dev]First post?

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ne...> - 2001-01-08 18:10

Hi there!


I hope you had enjoyed your Christmas and New year festivities.
For those of us that remeain tuned (not on vacation yet), I would
like to remind that dillo-0.3.1 was released and that its ready
for download at the regular place.

Well, it seems that this 2001 year has troubled computers a bit
more than the so publicited Y2k. Some servers are working partly
and frankly I don't know if our mailing list is up. BTW: I
haven't received mail from developers since Dec 2000...
Particularly, I want to contact Sebastian (I wrote hime twice
before this mailing-list-try).

Sourceforge still has problems with hit counters (page and
downloads), but everything else seems fine.


Cheers
Jorge.-
