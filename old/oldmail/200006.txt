[Dillo-dev]progress

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2000-06-28 17:45

Hi there!

We are getting closer to a new release due to several changes
in the code. Current Changelog looks like this:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
dillo-0.2.2 [July ?, 2000]

- * Added a gtk_window_set_wmclass to all windows to prevent dialogs
from having the same size as the main window. (Ex: with Sawfish)
Patch Jörgen Viksell <vsksga@ho...>
- * Fixed a segfault when calling "about:" method
Patch: Dominic Wong <lwong@ch...>
- * Added an option to force dillorc-defined colors (Try it with slashdot!)
* Fixed display of encoded-URL-links on the status bar
Patches: Adam Sampson <azz@gn...>
- * Removed several compiler dependencies
(detected with lcc on a 64 bit machine)
* Modified mime.c and Url.c to use list.h, and eliminated hdlr.c
* Standarized unsigned types to glib all around the code
* Added some includes for libc5 compatibility
* Modified IO_callback to avoid a CPU-hog (it happened in some systems).
* Fixed a bug that added a trailing ampersand to GET and POST queries.
* FIxed attribute parsing. It had nasty side effects; as providing
wrong attribute values to POST and GET methods.
* Joined Url.c and url.c into a single module.
* Reimplemented URL resolving functions.
* Implemented a new parser for "file:" URLs (Try "file:" & "file:.").
Patches: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@ma...>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


If you read it carefully, you'll notice several improvements,
most notably:

- POST & GET work better (google search is working!).
- "file:" URLs got better handled.
- slashdot is readable.
- The code got more "portable" and stable.


I'd like to include Jörgen patches too (if they get finished):

Maybe due to a lack of a window for the button widget.
This happened with the horizontal ruler, and the first attempt
to fix it, by packing it into an event box, worked OK.
I'm not sure though, just a thing to check.

If you finish them please let me know.

Dominic asks:

Well, that's due to threaded code (pthreads).
When dillo starts, there's just a single thread running (the
main thread). When another thread is spawned for the first time,
(due to a DNS, or local file request), TWO more threads get
running, one for the thread scheduler and other for the spawned
process. When the spawned one finishes, the thread manager
remains; if you 'ps aux | grep dillo', you'll see two processes
that consume the same memory size but THAT'S NOT TRUE!!!
Pthreads are light weight processes that run using the same
memory space as the father (one of the advantages over fork).

CscHTML:

Certainly to be taken into account.
When I first downloaded it, found almost no documentation for
it, appart from 350Kb of code and library dependencies.

Haven't tested the speed yet.

The biggest concern is the cost of making the widget change,
and the loose of control over the rendering. Currently we have a
widget set that needs moderate work to start handling tables (and
that's lean, fast and already integrated to our browser).

I think if we manage to provide a basic TABLE facility with Dw,
developers will start to work together improving it. The
advantage of having small, documented code is a nicer learning
curve that lets developers jump-in quickly.
BTW our main documentation fault is on Dw (dillo widget); any
contribution will be highly appreciated. :-)

On the other hand, if we fail to improve Dw, the change is
almost forced (if possible).

This remains an open issue.

Ps: Thanks for reading this far.
Ps2: Jörgen, I'll send you an email to your hotmail address, at
the same time I send this one to the list, please let me
know if you receive it (I've had problems with hotmail.com). 



[Dillo-dev]CSCHTML widget

From: <bigdaddy@ll...> - 2000-06-26 18:00

Check this out
http://www.cscmail.net/cschtml/

this appears to be a GTK widget with _all_ html tags. I haven't done
extensive research into this, but this could be huge. It may be worth
while to look into this.

[Dillo-dev]form fixes

From: Jörgen Viksell <vsksga@ho...> - 2000-06-25 18:11

Hi!

I have been working on getting checkbuttons and radiobuttons to render 
properly, and it works now. Strangely enough it works when you call
gtk_toggle_button_set_mode(GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON(widget), FALSE), even though 
this is supposed to be set by default...
What bugs me now is that radio buttons appears as squares instead of 
diamond-shaped.

I also worked on the SELECT stuff (width and height of the clist widget) 
which now seems to work.

The patch can be found here:
http://hem.passagen.se/vsksga/patches/patch-0.2.1-form_fixes

I would appreciate if someone could try it out. And maybe fix the bugs =)

// Jörgen

Hi everyone!


First, I want to welcome every new member of this list. 

I'm eager to "hear" your impressions and comments on dillo but
it seems that the ematic server went down the hard way, and I
haven't received mail since early Jun 18. So please, if you had
sent me mail, please resend it to jcid@ma....

We have new patches! I've also found a couple of bugs that
will be nailed down pretty soon.


regards
Jorge.-

Andrew:

> The new release seems to work well. Thanks!

Good!
It was tested on Slackware 7.0, Slackware 3.6 libc5 (with a few
changes), Redhat 6.2 and Suse.

It behaves very stable here and I hope it works the same for
everyone.

> Is it just me or has bug 9 disappeared? (The one with mishandled # tags).
> I browsed around a page with them in it and I never saw page.html#a#b or
> anything like that. 

No, the bug IS there; it just hides! :)

If you browse a page that has a # anchor to another page,
there's no problem, but if the # refers to the same page -> BUG.

Test this one: http://dillo.inf.utfsm.cl/test/spg.htm

> And, for that matter, how many of those other bugs have been fixed in
> Dillo 0.2.0 without the database being updated?

Not a single one. The database reflects current state.

I left bug #35 there cause the BUG remains there; mitigated but
still alive...


> Thanks,

You're welcome.

Pd: Updated "--" to "McPherson" 



Re: [Dillo-dev]New release

From: Andrew McPherson <andrew@ma...> - 2000-06-07 00:19

The new release seems to work well. Thanks!

Is it just me or has bug 9 disappeared? (The one with mishandled # tags).
I browsed around a page with them in it and I never saw page.html#a#b or
anything like that. Did somebody fix that without updating the bug-track
engine?

And, for that matter, how many of those other bugs have been fixed in
Dillo 0.2.0 without the database being updated?

Thanks,

-Andrew 



[Dillo-dev]New release

From: Jorge Arellano Cid <jcid@em...> - 2000-06-03 03:16

Hi!

Its been a long long time since the last release (two months)
and I want to apologize for this. Although work had been hectic
on my side, I couldn't make it in less time...

Well, an evolving model, and always releasing a better browser
are good rules to follow.

The good news is that we have a HALF-NEW browser!!!
(Check the Changelog.who for details)

I hope you enjoy this version.
Feedback is encouraged.-


Jorge.-


Pd : I'll update the web site ASAP (maybe on Monday).

Pd2: Luca:
I didn't include your justification patch in this version
cause it broke the rendering of some pages.
